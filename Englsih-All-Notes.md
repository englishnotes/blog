Question :  do/does + S + V1  (do i? does he?)

### **Usage (fact, habit)**

1. For something which happens, (Action is **regular** , **habitual**   or **repeatedly** ) (things in general)
   We go out every Saturday night regularly or which is a habit. I usually go away at weekends.
2. For a **fact**  , The earth travels around the sun. The earth goes around the sun. Two and two make four
3. To give **instructions** ,    First you check the gears and handbrake, then you switch on the engine.
4. To **describe events**  in jokes, stories, news : Real Madrid beats Milan.
5. For **future events**  on a timetable or a fixed program, The match begins at 3:30 pm

- **State verbs:**  I know football. i like apple
  like, want, need, prefer
  know, realise, suppose, mean, understand, believe, remember
  belong, fit, contain, consist, seem

- **"to be"** : **with the main verb am/is/are**
  I'm Turkish.
  She is hungry.
  They're always late.
  We aren't at home. Are you from Turkey. She is a doctor. They are smart.

  positive: I'm, You're, It's, She's, he's, we're, they're
  negative: I'm not, You're not, It's not, She's not, he's not, we're not, they're not
  yes/no questions; am i, are you, is he, is she, is it, are we, are they
  Wh questions: Where am I ? What are yo u? Why is he? Who is she ? When are we ? How are they ?
  Wh : When, Where, What, Who, Why, How

- Have - Has
  Do - does
  go - goes

- With the present simple, we use the word “do“. The word “do“ hasn’t got a meaning, but we use it in questions and negative sentences.
For example, we say “Do you speak Japanese?“ and “You do not speak Japanese“.
- For “he“, “she“ and “it“, we use the word “does“.
For example, we say “Does he speak Japanese?“ and “He does not speak Japanese“.
- For the negative of the present simple, we use the words “do not“ and we say “I do not speak Chinese“.
The contraction of “do not“ is “don’t“ – “I don’t speak Chinese“.
- For “he“, “she“ and “it“, we use the words “does not“ for the negative, and we say “He does not speak Chinese“.
The contraction of “does not“ is “doesn’t“ – “He doesn’t speak Chinese“.

- now you are speaking English, but generally, you speak...
- He doesn't do anything.
- He is not reading a book now, but generally, he reads books.

- Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius
- Excuse me, do you speak English

Are you wearing a hat? No i'm not wearing a hat but i wear a hat
Do you wear a hat? yes I wear a hat

 **Present simple for the future**
- We use the present simple to speak about a future action when we are talking about timetables or schedules.
For example, we can say “The film starts at 10 p.m.“, “My train leaves in fifteen minutes“, or “England play football against Germany next Saturday“.

 **Future time clauses**
- As we know, we cannot use future verb forms in time clauses; we use present verb forms instead. We cannot say “When I will eat dinner, I will watch TV“. We must say either
“When I eat dinner, I will watch TV”
or
“When I have eaten dinner, I will watch TV”.

If I use the present simple and say “When I eat dinner, I will watch TV“, it is possible that the two actions will happenat the same time or one after the other.
On the other hand, if I use the present perfect and say “When I have eaten dinner, I will watch TV“, I am emphasizing that I willfirst eat dinner and then, afterthat, I will watch TV.

## 2.2 Present Continuous

I am doing, You are doing, He is doing, Tom is doing

Positive  :  S +am/is/are + V1ing   (I'm  doing, She is doing. We are doing, John is doing)
Negative :  S + am/is/are+ not + V1ing  (you aren't doing)
Question :  am/is/are+ S + V1ing  (is he swiming)

Contractions:
He's = he is

he/she/it isn't  = is not
we're  = we are

### **Usage (in proggress)**  
 **1-**  Action going on at present time.
    For an event in progress at the present time.   
    We use the present continuous for an action that **we are doing now** .
Look, they're coming out of the cinema now.
I'm trying to work

 **2-**  Sometimes the action is **not happening at the  time of speaking**
   I'm reading a really good book. (but I'm not reading at the time of speaking)

 **3-**  We use the present continuous when we talk about **changes happening**  around now
especially these words ( **get, change, become, increase, rise, fall, grow, improve, begin, start** )
   Is your English getting better?

 **4-**   **Repeated actions** , with " **always** ", to show surprise or disapproval when an **action is repeated** .
She always borrowing money from me.    
.... always ....V1ing
you're always playing computer games.

 **5-**  Present continuous for the future. ( **arrangement)**
- However, we can also use the present continuous and say “ **We're going to**  the theatre”
if we want to communicate that the visit has already been **arranged** ; we have already bought the tickets, for example.
I'm coming to school tomorrow, (arranged)
I'm going away next weekend.
We're flying to Spain next week.
Are you coming to school tomorrow?

- **State verbs**  aren't used in continuous tenses.
some verbs are not normally used in the present continuous tense
we use instead of "simple tense"
I'm hungry. I want  something to eat (not I'm wanting)
do you understand what I mean?
anna doesn't seem very happy at the moment.
do you see that man over there? (not are you seeing)
 like, want, need, prefer
 know, realize, suppose, mean, understand, believe, remember
 belong, fit, contain, consist, seem
 see, hear, smell, taste
 look feel,

 **- To be going to**
- As we know, we use “to be going to” to communicate a **future intention** .
For example, the sentence “ **We're going to go** to the theatre” suggests that we have already decided to go to the theatre; it is our intention to go.
“I’m going to keep studying English for a few more years”.

- One use of “to be going to” is to say what we **think will happen**  because of something we know now.
For example,
“The sky is very dark now; I think it’s going to rain”, or
“John is a very good student; he’s going to do well in his exams”.


### **Examples**
I am going to the door;
I am coming from the door; I am closing the book;
I am opening the book.
I'm trying to work
he's having a shower
she's driving to work
it isn't raining anymore
are you enjoying the party
what's going on?
i'am reading a really good book.
she's learning English
is your English getting better

it's getting late (with adj.)
I am taking.
he/she is taking,
we/you/they are taking
I am waiting for Ashok
Are you going away next weekend (arrangement)

eger state bildiren (aksiyon bildirmeyen) bir fiil varsa, I like sweets, it looks taste

## 2.3 Present Perfect

I have done

"Have" + past participle
Positive  :  S +have/has + V3   (i have done, She has done etc.) (S + have/has + V1ed)
Negative :  S + have/has+ not + V3  (you have not swum)
Question :  have/has+ S + V3  (has he swum)

Contractions:
i've spoken  (i have)
he's/she's/it's spoken (he has spoken)
he/she/it hasn't spoken (has not)
we've spoken (we have)

### **Usage (Action completed at the time of speaking )**
1- For an event which is finished but still **effects**  the present. (the action in the past has a result now.)
    I can't write because I've broken my arm.
    I've cut my finger
2- Action just ended, Action which happened at an indefinite time
    I've seen "The Truman Show" twice, in the past
3- For an event which began in the past and is still going on.
    She's been a window for about six months.

- A completed action without a specified time in the past
- action completed at some point in the past
- There is no time specified in the past
- The following expressions **require** this tense: ** already, so far, not yet, recently, just, ever, never,  today until now**   etc.

- We use it to talk about our **experiences** . If I say “I have eaten Chinese food“, it means I have experience of “eating Chinese food“. If I say “I have been to Paris“, it means that I have experience of “being in Paris“.
- We also use the present perfect to talk about the duration of an action **up to now** . If I say “I have lived here for three years“, it means that I’m living here now and I started living here three years ago.
- We can also use the present perfect to talk about the **result now of a past action** . For example, “I have eaten too much“ means that I feel bad (or guilty) now. “She has arrived“ means that she is here now.

- **Action verbs** :
  - She has already written 40 books.
  - I've played tennis with her once.
  - He has driven 300 kmso far.
  - It has rained thee timesthis week.

- **State verbs** : "to be", "to have" "to know" etc.
it's shows a state that continuous
with the state verb the "present perfect" has replaces "present perfect continuous"
  - She has been a writer for 15 years
  - I've been happyall day
  - I have been sadtoday.
  - i have known her since 2010

- **"to be"** : **with the main verb been**
I have been to italy

 **Present perfect / Past simple**
The difference between the present perfect and the past simple is that we use the present perfect when we are thinking about time before or up to now, whereas we use the past simple when we are thinking about a specific past time. For example, “I have been here for twenty minutes; I arrived here twenty minutes ago“.

We have two sentences:

1) “Mr Brown has been to Scotland“ and
2) “Mr Brown has gone to Scotland“.

The first sentence, “Mr Brown has been to Scotland“, means that he has visited Scotland in his life but is not there now. The second sentence, “Mr Brown has gone to Scotland“, means he is in Scotland; he isn’t here now.

We can say “Mr Brown has gone to Scotland“, because he is not here now, but we can’t say “I have gone to Scotland“, because that means I am not here now, which is impossible.

Now think about this sentence:
“I ate eggs for breakfast today.”

In sentences like this, some students make the mistake of saying “I have eaten” because they are using the word “today”. This is wrong. We say “I ate eggs for breakfast today” because, as the rule tells us, we are thinking about what happened at a specific past time – breakfast time. The fact that the word “today” is in the sentence changes nothing; we are not thinking about now. We are thinking about breakfast time, which is a specific past time.

### Example

i have already written the letter
The road is closed. There's been an accident.

* Difference between **gone to* * and **been to**
He has gone to italy (he is there now) or (on his way there)
He has been to italy (he has now come back)

## 2.4 Present Perfect Continuous

I have been doing, She has been doing.  

Positive  :  S +have/has +been + V1ing   (i have been doing)
Negative :  S + have/has+ not + been +V1ing  (you have not  been doing)
Question :  have/has+ S + been +V1ing  (has he been doing)

Contraction:
I 've been speaking  (i have)
he's/she's/it's been speaking (he has  been speaking)
he/she/it hasn't been speaking (has not)
we've been speaking (we have)

### **Usage (action started in the past, is still in progress)**
- Action that has already started and is still going on.
I have been doing, She has been doing.  etc.

- We use ** specific time marker**  since, for etc.
- She has been writing books **for**   over 20 years
- She has been writing books **since**   she was 18
- She has been driving for  three hours
- It has been raining all day
- We've been living here for 6 years.

- We use the **present perfect continuous**  to say how long an action has
been in progress so far. We are “measuring“ the duration of the action up
to now.
For example, if you arrive at work at 9 a.m., then at 10 a.m. you
can say “I have been working for one hour so far“; later, at 11 a.m., you
can say “I have been working for two hours so far“.

 **Present perfect continuous: evidence of recent activity:**
We can use the perfect continuous tenses to communicate the duration of an action up to a particular point.
“I have been working for one hour so far“.
In addition, we can use the present perfect continuous when there is evidence now of a recent activity.
“Look at Lucy’s eyes; I think she’s been crying“ or “The road’s wet. It’s been raining“.

We can use the past perfect continuous in the same way. For example, “When I arrived at David’s house last night, I could tell he had been cooking“.

 **Compere perfect continuous tenses** :
Present perfect continuous: I have been working
Past perfect continuous: I had been working
Future perfect continuous: I will have been working

We use the past perfect continuous to communicate the duration of an
action up to a particular point in the past. We are “measuring“ how long
the action had already been in progress at that point. For example, the
sentence “I had been cooking for twenty minutes when she arrived“
means that I started cooking and then twenty minutes later she arrived.

We use the future perfect continuous to communicate the duration of an
action up to a particular point in the future. For example, “At the end of
this lesson, we will have been studying for … minutes“.

Notice that there is no important difference between saying “I have been
living here for two months“ and “I have lived here for two months“.
When speaking about duration, we can normally use either the perfect
continuous tenses or the perfect tenses.

# 3 Past Tenses

## 3.1 Past Simple

I did

Positive  :  S + V2  ( I did, she did  ) (V2, ed)
Negative :  S + didn't+ V1  (I didn't swim)
Question :  did + S + V1  (did I swim)

Contraction:
I didn't watch TV (did not)

### **Usage (Action completed at the specific time in the past)**
1- A completed action at the specified time in the past.
    Last night i went to a concert
2- To describe a past habit
    When I was at school, I got up every day at 7 o'clock.
- Any time expression that refers to a **specific time in the past requires**  this tense.
- It's similar to the "present simple" because it has different rules for the verb 'be', which becomes 'was' or 'were':

- **"to be": with the main verb was/were**
I was a doctor.
They were smart people.
you were a doctor.
She was hungry.
They were late.
We weren't at home.

- **Action verbs** :
  - We spoke English during thelast lesson
  - I came hereat 10:00 Am
  - I broke armwhen i was a little child,
  - I watched the TVyesterday
  - He drove 300 kmbefore sunrise

- ** State verbs** :
  - You were sad
  - you were tired
  - I was happy

 **Past tense of regular verbs: -ed**
We form the past tense of regular verbs by putting the letters “ed“ at the end.
For example, “walk – walked”; “talk – talked”; “work – worked”; “live – lived” etc. We say “I generally walk a lot; I walked a lot yesterday“.

We only put “ed“ at the end of the verb in the positive. To make questions and negative sentences, we use “did“ and the infinitive without “to“.
For example, “Did you work yesterday?“ – “No, I didn’t work yesterday“.



## 3.2 Past Continuous

I was doing, you were doing

Positive  :  S + was/were +V1ing  ( i was swiming )
Negative :  S + was't/weren't+ V1ing  (i wasn't swiming)
Question :  was/were + S + V1ing (was i swiming)

Contraction:
i wasn't watching TV (was not)
you weren't going (were not)

### **Usage**
1- Action **in progress in the past**  (action going on in the past or for an action that wasin progress at a particular time in the past)
   I was driving along the motorway when  i had a puncture. (puncture: lastik patlamasi)
2- for 2 or more events which were in progress at the same time in the past
   i was digging the garden while John was painting the kitchen.
3- for an event which had been arranged but which didn't happen
   He was coming to dinner but he had to go away on business.

She was writing that novel **when**  she became ill
I was speaking English at this time yesterday.
If I say “I was sleeping at 4 o’clock this morning“, it means that I went to sleep before 4 o’clock and I woke up after 4 o’clock; at 4 o’clock, I was in the middle of a period of sleeping.

- The most common use of the past continuous is to say that an action was in progress when another action happened.
I was cooking lunch when she arrived (means that, when she arrived, I was in the middle of cooking lunch.)
i was driving the my car, she arrived home

 **Was + infinitive with “to”**
“Was“ (or “were“) followed by an infinitive with “to“ expresses a future event in relation to a point in the past.
For example, “I did not realize when we first started this job that it was to be so difficult“.

## 3.3 Past Perfect

I had done, we had done etc.

Positive  :  S + had+V3  ( i had swum )
Negative :  S + hadn't+ V3  (i hadn't swum)
Question :  had + S + V3 (had i swum)

Contraction:
i'd gone (i had gone)
he'd done (he had gone)
i hadn't watching TV (had not)

### **Usage**
1- for an event which happened before another in the past (action took place before another action)
- Action that was completed in the past.
- She had written that novelbefore she became ill.

The past perfect communicates the same idea as the present perfect except that, instead of thinking about time before and up to now,
we are thinking about time before and up to a specific point in the past.
For example, with the present perfect, we can say
“Mary cannot enter her flat because she has lost her key“. With the past perfect, we can say
“Mary could not enter her flat yesterday because she had lost her key“.

### **Examples**

1- I went back home because i'd forgotten my keys.
when i came, he'd finished his work



## 3.4 Past Perfect Continuous

I had been doing, we had been doing

Positive  :  S + had+ been +V1ing  ( i had been swiming )
Negative :  S + hadn't+ been+ V1ing  (i hadn't been swiming)
Question :  had + S +been+ V1ing (had i been swiming)

Contraction:
i'd been going (i had been going)
he'd been going (he had been going)
i hadn't been watching TV (had not)

### **Usage**
1- To emphasize the continuous activity which happened before another in the past
 action lasted for some time before another action
They had been studying four hours when they suddenly realized it was midnight.
2- A longer action in the past occurred before another action.
- I had been doing
- She had been writing that novel for a few months when she became ill
- when i returned he had been working for 2 hrs
- We use thepast perfect continuous to communicate the duration of an
action up to a particular point in the past. We are “measuring“ how long
the action had already been in progress at that point.
For example, the
sentence “I had been cooking for twenty minutes when she arrived“
means that I started cooking and then twenty minutes later she arrived.


# 4 Future Tenses

## 4.1 Future Simple

i will do, she will do. etc.

Positive  :  S + will/shall +V1  ( i will swim )
Negative :  S + will notl+ V1  (i won't swim)
Question :  will + S + V1 (will you swim)

### **Usage**
1- to make a prediction about the future
2- just this moment decided to do something

- I will do
- I will call him as soon as i can
- I will probably call him this night

### **Be going to**
i am going to do, she is going to do etc.
- Action in the future that has already been planed by the speaker
- I am going to do
- I am going to call Emma after lunch
- I know he is going to invite me out

"Present Continuous" with the future time marker
- Fixed arrangement for the future..
- I am doing + future time marker
- I'am having dinner with Dann tonight.

We form the future tense with the word “will” and the infinitive without “to”.
The future of “I go“ is “I will go“. The future of “you go“ is “you will go“.
The complete future tense of the verb “to go“ is “I will go“, “you will go“, “he will go“, “she will go“ etc.

 **Contraction:**
“I will not“ = “I won’t“.
“you will not“ = “you won’t“.
I will = I'll
I will not = I won't

book will = book'll
tomorrow will = tomorrow'll
who will = who'll
what will = what'll

The contraction of “book will” is “book’ll”; “tomorrow will = tomorrow’ll”;
“Mr Smith will = Mr Smith’ll”;
“who will = who’ll”;
“what will = what’ll” etc.

We generally use contractions when we speak, but we don’t use them if they are difficult to pronounce. For example, we say “pen’ll” but not “pencil’ll

 **Shall (Suggestion)**

- We use “shall” instead of “will” when we are making a suggestion with the pronoun “I” or “we”.
For example, we say “Shall I open the window?”,
“Shall we go to the cinema?” etc.

- We can also ask somebody for a suggestion with “shall”.
For example, we can ask “What shall I do?”, “Where shall we go?” etc.

 **"Will": future tense**

Two common ways to talk about the future are:
- I will go to London tomorrow (future simple)
- I am going to go to London tomorrow (“to be going to“)

These different forms communicate different ideas.
One common use of the future simple is to communicate that **we have just this moment decided to do something.**
For example, if I say “It’s getting cold; I’ll close the window“,
I am communicating that I have just this moment decided to close the window.

We can also use the future simple **to make a prediction.**
For example, if I say to a friend “Don’t worry about your exam tomorrow; I’m sure it will be easy“,
  am making a prediction that the exam will be easy.

 **“To be going to“: future tense (gonna)**

- To  be going to kullaninca, will in kullanimini bir seviye daha kuvvetlendiriyoruz
will yerine kullanirsak, su anda karar vermemisiz daha onceden karar vermisiz anlamina geliyor
animsatici: *eskiden karar verdik o karar kendi basina gidiyor going to   --going to-->*

- "To be going to" can also be used to make a prediction, but a prediction using information we already have.
For example, if I say “Oh, look at the sky; I think it’s going to rain“,
I am predicting rain because I can see that the sky is dark and cloudy now.

- Another common use of “to be going to“ is to communicate a future intention;
something that **we have already decided to do**  .
For example, if I say “I’m going to buy a new car“, I am communicating that I have already
decided to buy a new car; it is my intention to buy one.
gonna: i'm gonna buy new car
i'mgoing to go home = i'm gonna go home

To communicate your future intentions, it is important to remember to use “to be going to”,
not the future simple.
If you decide to watch a film tonight, and then later you tell a friend what you have decided to do, you
should say “I’m going to watch a film tonight”. It is wrong in this situation
to say “I will watch a film tonight”. This is a very common mistake.


### Examples

1- I guess out team will win the match next week.
2- if I say “It’s getting cold; I’ll close the window“

I shall watch th Tv

i/we/you/they will take, he/she/it will take
i will meet him next week

-----------
### “Will”  vs  “to be going to”

Two common ways to talk about the future are:

1- I will go to London tomorrow (future simple)
2- I am going to go to London tomorrow (“to be going to“)

### WILL

**Decided just this moment**
These different forms communicate different ideas.
One common use of the future simple is to communicate that
we have just this moment decided to do something.
For example,
if I say “It’s getting cold; I’ll close the window“,
I am communicating that I have just this moment decided to close the window.

Prediction
We can also use the future simple to make a prediction. For example, if I say to a friend
“Don’t worry about your exam tomorrow; I’m sure it will be easy“,
I am making a prediction that the exam will be easy.


### TO BE GOING TO

**Not:** to  be going to kullaninca, will in kullanimini bir seviye daha kuvvetlendiriyoruz
will yerine kullanirsak, su anda karar vermemisiz daha onceden karar vermisiz oluyor
eskiden karar verdik o karar kendi basina gidiyor going to   ---->
prediction yerine kullanirsak, birlgiye dayali bir tahmin sekline donusuyor.

**Intention, already decided**
Another common use of “to be going to“ is to communicate a future
intention; something that we have already decided to do. For example, if
I say “I’m going to buy a new car“, I am communicating that I have already
decided to buy a new car; it is my intention to buy one.

**Prediction**
“To be going to“ can also be used to make a prediction, but a prediction
using information we already have. For example, if I say “Oh, look at the
sky; I think it’s going to rain“, I am predicting rain because I can see that
the sky is dark and cloudy now.

To communicate your future intentions, it is important to remember to
use “to be going to”, not the future simple. If you decide to watch a film
tonight, and then later you tell a friend what you have decided to do, you
should say “I’m going to watch a film tonight”. It is wrong in this situation
to say “I will watch a film tonight”. This is a very common mistake.

## 4.2 Future Continuous

I will be doing, we will be doing etc.

Positive  :  S +will/shall+ be + V1ing   (i will be swiming)
Negative :  S + will/shall+ not + be + V1ing   (you will not be swiming)

## 4.3 Future Perfect

I will have done, We will have done etc.

Positive  :  S +will/shall+ have + V3   (i will have swum)
Negative :  S + will/shall+ not  + V3   (you will have swum)

action will take place before another action
They'll have done their homework by tomorrow
she will have prepared meals before i return.
I will have eaten
I will have swum

- Action that will be completed in the future.
- i will have done (yapmış olacağım)

aksiyonun bittigi ani anlatiyor (ben yemis olacagim)

We use the future perfect when we are thinking about time before and  up to a specific point in the future.
For example,
if you know that you will be in bed at midnight tonight, you can tell a friend
“Please don’t phone me at midnight; I will have gone to bed“.
This communicates that you will go to bed before midnight and that,
at midnight, you will be in bed, probably sleeping.

When you arrive at my house, I will have cooked dinner

i/we/you/they/he/she/it will or shall have taken

aksiyonun bittigi ani anlatiyor (ben yemis olacagim)

We use the future perfect when we are thinking about

if you know that you will be in bed at midnight tonight,
you can tell a friend
“Please don’t phone me at midnight; I will have gone to bed“.

## 4.4 Future Perfect Continuous

I will have been doing

Positive  :  S +will/shall+ have + been + V1ing   (i will have been swiming)
Negative :  S + will/shall+ not  + been+ V1ing   (you will not have been swiming)
Question :  will/shall+ S + been + V1ing   (will he have been swiming)

Contraction:
he won't have been swiming (will not)

### **Usage**
-  for something still in progress but which will be complete not leter
action will last for some time before another action
He'll have been working for the bank for 30 years next summer.
by the time i return, she will have been waiting for 2 hrs

I will have been doing. We will have been doing etc.
Action that will have started, continued for the some time and will still be in progress in the future.
- i will have been doing (yapmış olacağım, yapacağım, x zamanda yapmış olacağım)

- We use the future perfect continuous to communicate the duration of an
action up to a particular point in the future. For example, “At the end of
this lesson, we will have been studying for … minutes“.

 **Compere perfect continuous tenses** :

Present perfect continuous: I have been working
Past perfect continuous: I had been working
Future perfect continuous: I will have been working

We use the present perfect continuous to say how long an action has
been in progress so far. We are “measuring“ the duration of the action up
to now. For example, if you arrive at work at 9 a.m., then at 10 a.m. you
can say “I have been working for one hour so far“; later, at 11 a.m., you
can say “I have been working for two hours so far“.

We use the past perfect continuous to communicate the duration of an
action up to a particular point in the past. We are “measuring“ how long
the action had already been in progress at that point. For example, the
sentence “I had been cooking for twenty minutes when she arrived“
means that I started cooking and then twenty minutes later she arrived.

We use the future perfect continuous to communicate the duration of an
action up to a particular point in the future. For example, “At the end of
this lesson, we will have been studying for … minutes“.

Notice that there is no important difference between saying “I have been
living here for two months“ and “I have lived here for two months“.
When speaking about duration, we can normally use either the perfect
continuous tenses or the perfect tenses.

# 6 Verbs

- A verb is a word we use for an action.
For example, “take”, “put”, “open”, “close“ etc. are verbs.
- The word “translate“ is a verb, whereas the word “translation“ is a noun.
- The word “mean“ is a verb, whereas the word “meaning“ is a noun.

- Action Verbs



- State Verbs : "to be", "to have" "to know" etc.
State verbs doesn't take continuous tense.
Some verbs are only (or mostly) used in simple tenses, and are not used in continuous tenses. An example of a simple tense is the present simple, or the past simple. An example of a continuous tense is the present continuous or past continuous. These verbs are called stative, or state verbs. A verb which isn’t stative is called a dynamic verb, and is usually an action. Often stative verbs are about liking or disliking something, or about a mental state, not about an action.

## 6.1 so

 **"So" - and its many uses**

 **so,**
 **so that,**
 **so as to,**
 **and so on**
 **so many**
 **so far**
 **so far as I know**

There are many expressions in English that contain the word “so”. Here are some examples:

1) “They were very cheap, (and) so I bought two of them”. Here, the word “so” means “therefore” or “consequently”.

2) “You should read it again, so that you can remember it well”. Here, the expression “so that” means “in order that”.

3) “Come early, so as to get a good seat”. Here, the expression “so as to” means “in order to”.

4) “Everybody was at the party – Sam, Louise, Richard and so on”. Here, the expression “and so on” means “etc”.

Here are some more uses of “so”:

5) “I never realized there were so many people living in that house”. Here, the expression “so many” means “such a large number of”. (For uncountable nouns, we use “so much”, meaning “such a large quantity of”.)

6) “I have not made any mistakes so far”. Here, the expression “so far” means “till now”.

7) “So far as I know, they left yesterday”. Here, the expression “so far as I know” means “as regards my knowledge of the situation”.

 **it is not so,**
 **so, you have come!**
 **it so happens**
 **I told you so**
 **just(exactly)**

Here are some more expressions in English that contain the word “so”:

1) “He said the train had left, but it was not so.“ Here, the word “so“ means “true.

2) “So, you’ve got a new job, I hear!“ Here, the word “so“ is used to start a conversation on a particular subject.

3) “It so happens I have just the thing you are looking for.“ Here, the expression “it so happens“ means “by chance“.

4) “I told you so! We spent too long in the restaurant, and now we’ve missed the last bus home!“ Here, the expression “I told you so“ means “This is exactly what I predicted“.


 **furthermore,  moreover**
The words “furthermore” and “moreover” mean “also”, and are often used at the beginning of the sentence in formal English. For example, “The goods arrived two weeks late. Furthermore, they were damaged”.     furthermore moreover
The word “moreover” often communicates that the information in the second sentence is more important than the information in the first. For example, “My boss praised me for my work yesterday. Moreover, he said he was going to pay me more money”.

 **swear-swore-sworn**
The verb “to swear” means to say bad words. People often swear when they hurt themselves or when they’re very angry.

 **lazy, idle**
The word “lazy“ means “not willing to work“. For example, “My brother is so lazy; he does nothing all day!“ The word “idle“ usually means the same as “lazy“, but only when we are describing people. For example, “Don’t be so idle. Go and find a job!“

When we are describing things, the word “idle“ means “not doing anything“. For example, “The ship remained idle in the port for two years“. We can sometimes use “idle“ with this meaning for people but it is not very common. For example, “I hate to be idle at work; I always like to be doing something useful“.

 **row, oar**
In the old days before steam, ships were made to move either by rowing with oars, or by using a sail.

## 6.2 primary auxiliary verb, modal auxiliary verb

 **be, have, do:**  primary auxiliaries

- English has two types of auxiliary verb: primary auxiliaries and modal auxiliaries (or “modals“).
We use them to make basic verb structures.
We use the auxiliary “be“ to make the continuous tenses, for example when we say “Iam speaking English now“.
We also use it for the passive voice, for example when we say “This bookwas printed in England“.
We use the auxiliary “have“ for the perfect tenses, for example when we say “Hehas gone to Scotland“.
We use the auxiliary “do“ for the present simple and past simple, for example when we say “Idon’t speak Spanish“ or “Did she eat the pasta?“

 **“can“, “could“,**
 **“will“, “would“,**
 **“may“, “might“,**
 **“shall“, “should“,**
 **“must“ and “ought“:**  Modals or modal auxiliaries
- Modals normally express ideas about necessity or possibility.

- After a modal, we put the infinitive without “to“. For example, we say “I must go“, and not “I must to go“.
The only exception to this rule is “ought“. We say, for example, “I should call my mum soon“, but if we express the same idea with “ought“, we say
“I ought to call my mum soon“.

- When a sentence is negative, however, we can use either “couldn’t“ or “wasn’t able“. We can say,
for example, “He looked for his keys for a long time but he couldn’t find them“.

 **“Should” and “ought to” for the past and future**
- We express the idea of past time with the modals “should“ and “ought to“ by following them with the word “have“ and a past participle. For example, we say “I should have told her, but I forgot“ or “He ought to have gone to the doctor yesterday, but he didn’t“. Notice that, if we say someone “should have done“ or “ought to have done“ something, it means that they did not, in fact, do it. The sentence “You should have phoned me“ means that you did not, in fact, phone me.

To express a future idea with “should“ or “ought to“, we just use a word or phrase that expresses future time.
For example, “I ought to go and see him tomorrow“.

 **Making requests**
There are many ways of requesting that somebody does something, but one common way is to say
“Can you ...?“ or “Could you ...?“ In a request, “could“ is more polite than “can“, and so
we often use “could“ when we are speaking to people we don’t know very well.
For example, we say “Excuse me, could you tell me the way to the station, please?“

Another common way of making a request is to say “Do you mind ...?“ or “Would you mind ...?“
For example, “Do you mind opening the window, please?“ or “Would you mind moving your chair a little, please?“
The difference is that “Would you mind ...?“ is perhaps more polite.
Notice that we put a gerund after the verb “mind“ in this type of request.

 **“Could” as the past of “can”**
We use “could“ as the past of “can“ to speak about general abilities.
For example, we say “I could swim when I was five years old“ or “When he lived in London, he could practise his English every day“.

- On the other hand, if we talk about a particular occasionwhen somebody managed to do something, we don’t use “could“; we use “was able“, “managed“ or “succeeded“ instead.
For example, we say “John studied a lot, andwas able to pass the exam“ or “The child fell into the swimming pool butmanaged to get out safely“.

 **“Need” as a modal verb**
The verb “need” can sometimes be used as a modal verb in questions and negative sentences (but not normally in positive sentences).
For example, instead of asking “Does she need to fill in a form?”, we can ask “Need she fill in a form?”, and instead of saying “You don’t need to pay the bill yet”, we can say “You needn’t pay the bill yet”.

When talking about the past, if somebody says that they needn’t have done something, it means that they did it, but it was, in fact, not necessary. For example, if a person says “I needn’t have studied so hard, because the exam was really easy”, it means that they did study hard, but it wasn’t necessary. However, if somebody says that they didn’t need to do something, it simply means that the action was not necessary, but it is not clear whether they did it or not.

## 6.3 The three forms of a verb

Present, Past, Past participle

 **1- Present:** walk, cut, sit, see
 **2- Past:** walked, cut, sat, saw
 **3- Past participle:** walked, cut, sat, seen

- Each verb in English has three forms.
For example, the three forms of the verb “to see“ are “see, saw, seen“,
where “see“ is the present, “saw“ is the past, and “seen“ is the past participle.

-  With regular verbs, the 2nd and 3rd forms are the same -
for example, “kill, killed, killed“.

- With irregular verbs,
sometimes all the forms are the same
for example, “put, put, put“;

sometimes two forms are the same
for example, “come, came, come“;

and sometimes all three forms are different –
for example, “give, gave, given“.

 - The past tenses of some verbs are irregular, and so we do not add “ed“ to form the past tense. Instead, we change the word.
For example, the past of “speak“ is “spoke“; the past of “come“ is “came“ etc.

 **The three forms of some important verbs   **  
have , had , had
am able, was able, been able
begin, began, begun
know, knew, known
swim, swam, swum
take, took, taken
shake, shook, shaken
write, wrote, written
forget, forgot, forgotten
break, broke, broken
eat, ate, eaten

speak - spoke
come - came
break - broke
wear - wore
write - wrote
get up - got up
stand - stood
shine - shone
take - took
tell - told
drive - drove
forget - forgot
see - saw

drink - drank
sleep - slept
leave - left
smell - smelt
learn - learnt

## 6.4 Transitive and intransitive verbs

The difference between a transitive verb and an intransitive verb is that a transitive verb has an object, whereas an intransitive verb does not have an object. The verb “to raise“ is transitive; that is, it has an object.

For example, “I (subject) am raising (verb) the book (object)“.

The verb “to rise“, however, is intransitive, which means that it does not have an object. For example, “The book (subject) is rising (verb)“.

Note that the object of a transitive verb is not always stated. For example, in the sentence “He ate quickly”, the object of the verb is obviously the food that he ate, although this is not stated.


_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-116_

## 6.5 Stative verbs

Some verbs are only (or mostly) used in simple tenses, and are not used in continuous tenses.
An example of a simple tense is the present simple, or the past simple.
An example of a continuous tense is the present continuous or past continuous.
These verbs are called stative, or state verbs. A verb which isn’t stative is called a dynamic verb, and is usually an action. Often stative verbs are about liking or disliking something, or about a mental state, not about an action.

## 6.8 “To be” + infinitive with “to”

 **“To be” + infinitive with “to”**

In formal English, there are two common uses of the structure “to be“ + infinitive with “to“.

Firstly, we use it in order to communicate an arrangement. For example, the sentence “The President is to meet the Queen“ means that this meeting has been arranged. This structure is often used in newspapers (instead of the structure “going to“).

Secondly, we can use this structure to communicate an obligation. For example, the sentence “You are to go to the head teacher’s study at once“ means you have to go to the head teacher’s study at once. It is an obligation.


 **bind-bound-bound**
Basically, the verb “to bind“ means “to tie“. For example, to bind a wound, to bind a book, to bind with a promise.


- "To be"  +  infinitie with "to"
   - Arrangement : "The President is to meet the Queen"
   - Obligation: "You are to go to the head teacher's study at once"

i am tall (simple present tense)
i was hungry (simple past tense)

i am being tired now (wrong)--> i am tired now
i am having a red car (wrong) --> I have a red car
i am knowing this man (wrong) ---> i know this man

## 6.11 Primary Auxiliary Verbs

 **am, is, are**
 **can, have, has**
 **do, does**

An auxiliary verb is part of the verb in a sentence, but it does not tell us the action.
For example, in the sentence “We are speaking“, the word “speaking“ tells us the action, and the word “are“ is an auxiliary verb. In the sentence “He can read“, the word “can“ is the auxiliary verb.
The auxiliary verb for the present simple is “do“.
For example, we say “Do you speak English?“ or “I do not have a bag".

### 6.11.1 To Be

#### To be

**am, is, are, was, were, will, shall**

| present      | past      | future      |
|:-------------|:----------|:------------|
| Am,  Is, Are | Was, Were | will, shall |
| Have, Has    | had       |             |


to be: olmak,
am, is, are : olmak,
was, were : olmak,
did  : olmak ,
will, shall  : olmak,
have/has  : olmak


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* We use the auxiliary “be“ to make the continuous tenses, for example
when we say “I am  speaking English now“.
* We also use it for the passive
voice, for example when we say “This book was  printed in England“.

fiil olarak kullanıldığında:

Asagidaki cumlelerde "To Be" fiili yani (am, is, are, was, were, will, shall) yardimci fiil olarak kullanilmamistir
ana fiil dir.

Be: Olmak

**My name is lisa**   (benim adim lisa olmak, "is" fiili genis zamanda olmak fiili olarak kullanilmistir.)
i am cold
i am a student
He was a doctor
This book was printed in England (was ile beraber Ving kullanilmamistir, passive voice olarak kullanilmistir.)
This book was printed in England cumlesi passive voice yapisindadir.

yardımcı  fiil  olarak kullanıldığında fiil ile birlikte kullanilirken, diger durumda kendisi fiildir.
I am doing
Are you swiming
it isn't sleaping

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- tense ler ile karistirilmamasi gereken konular

to be (am / is / are)  eylem ile birlikte kullanılır ise şimdiki zaman olur, ve görevi yardımcı fiil dir
yani bir action ile kullanılırsa present continuous tense olur

i am playing tennis  (simdiki zamanda kullanilan bir yardimci fiil)
you are driving the car  (simdiki zamanda kullanilan bir yardimci fiil)

to be (am / is / are) eylem ile birlikte kullanılmaz ise kendisi bir fiil durumundadır.
yani bir action yok ise,  kendisi action belirtir,
çünkü bir oluş(state) cümlesinde "olmak" anlamında kullanılır.
Bu durumda continuous tense lerde yer alamazlar, simple tens lere kayarlar.

your father is  doctor  (is, genis zamanda fiil olarak kullanilmis)
my shoes are  red  (are, genis zamanda bir fiil olarak kullanilmis)


=======================================

**genis zaman kullanimlari**
you don't speak

## 6.12 Modals Auxiliary Verbs

### 6.12.1 Modal auxiliary for probability

 **must, might**
In order to communicate our ideas about how probable we think something is, we often use words such as “sure“, “probably“ or “perhaps“.
However, another common way of communicating these ideas is by using modal auxiliary verbs such as “must“, “might“ etc.
For example, instead of saying “Perhaps David is Australian“, we can say "Davidmight be Australian".

The modal “must“ can express the idea that we are sure something is true because it makes logical sense in a particular situation.
For example, if somebody says “John has just run 30 kilometres“, we can reply “Hemust be tired“.
This is similar to saying “Judging from what you’ve just told me, I’m sure he is tired“.

 **should, ought to**
The modals “should“ and “ought to“ can express the idea of “probably“.
For example, we can say “The train should arrive soon“. This means the same as “I think the train will probably arrive soon“.

 **Could**
The modals “may“, “might“ and “could“ can express the idea of “perhaps“.
For example, if somebody asks us “Do you know where Sarah is?“, we can answer “She could be in her office“.
This is similar to saying “Perhaps she’s in her office“.      

 **can't**
The modal “can’t“ expresses the idea that we are sure something is not true because it makes no logical sense in a particular situation.
For example, if somebody says “This is Peter’s jacket“, we can say “No, it can’t be Peter’s jacket; it’s too small“.

When we use modals in this way, we put the word “have“ and a past participle after the modal when we are talking about something that happened in the past.
For example, “John ran 30 kilometres yesterday. He must have been very tired when he finished“.

 **- Have to = must**
“Have to” means the same as “must”. We can say “I must go to school” or “I have to go to school”.

- However, we cannot use “must” to speak about the past. Instead, we use “had to” and say “Yesterday,I had to go to school”.

“I don’t have to do it“means that I can do it if I want, but it is not necessary.
“I mustn’t do it“ means that it is bad or wrong to do it.

## 6.13 Imperatives

 **Imperatives:**
take, put, open, close, please etc.
- Open the book, please.
- Close the book, please.
- Put the book on the table, please.

When we want to say something stronger than just a suggestion, or even order someone to do something, we use the imperative.
In English, the imperative is very easy; we just use the infinitive without “to“.
For example, we say “Go away!“ For a negative imperative, we put the word
“don’t“ before the infinitive. For example, we say “Don’t go away!“


## 6.14 Go, get, Make or Do

 **Make or Do**

yeni birseyler yaparken make kullaniiyoruz.
rutin bir isten bahsederken ise do kullaniyoruz.

ornek.

make a cake
make a suggestion
make a progress

do the dishes
do  housework
do exercise

## 6.15 Strong and weak pronunciation forms

 **can**
 **than**
 **but**
 **some**
 **your**
 **to**
 **are**
 **was**

In English, many common words have a “strong“ pronunciation form and a “weak“ pronunciation form.
For example, the strong form of the word “can“ is /kæn/, whereas the weak form is /kən/. With the weak form, the vowel in the word is usually the sound /ə/, which is the most common sound in the English language.

We use the weak pronunciation form of a word when we say the word normally in a sentence without any special stress. For example, we say “I /kən/ speak three languages”.

We use the strong pronunciation form when we say the word on its own, or when we put stress on the word for some reason. For example, if someone says “You can’t speak three languages“, we might reply emphatically and say “Yes, I /kæn/!“

 **latest, last, last but one**
One important difference between “latest“ and “last“ is that, if I say “John Brown’s latest book is excellent“, it means John Brown’s newest book. However, if I say “John Brown’s last book was excellent“, it probably means the book he wrote before his new one, or it means his final book ever, because he has now retired or died.


_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-141_

## 6.16 "Will" and "would" for habits

We usually use the word “will“ to speak about the future, but we can also use it for a present habit, especially when we want to communicate that the habit is typical of a particular person.
For example, we can say “Most people here finish work at about 6 p.m., but Frank will stay at the office until 11 p.m. most days“. If we are speaking about a past habit, we use “would“ instead.
For example, “When I was at university, I would get up at 5 a.m. every day and go jogging“.

When speaking about past habits, the difference between “would“ and “used to“ is that we can use “would“ only to speak about behaviour, whereas we can use “used to“ to speak about both behaviour and states.
For example, we can say “Anna used to have long hair“, but we cannot say “Anna would have long hair“, because we are speaking about a state and not someone’s behaviour.

# 7 Conditionals - if and wish

## 7.1 1st Conditional, 2nd Conditional

 **1st Conditional**

“If” + present + “will do” = **real possibility**

If I go to the park tomorrow, I will play football

This sentence means that I think there is areal possibilitythat I will go to the park tomorrow, and, if I do, I will play football.
It communicates that we think something is a real possibility.

 **2nd Conditional**
“If + past + “would do” = **only imagining**

If I went to the park tomorrow, I would play football

This sentence means that I think it is very improbable that I will go to the park tomorrow; I am only imagining it.
It communicates that we are only imagining something.

It is important to understand that, in the 2nd conditional, we use the past simple after “if“,
but we are not thinking about past time; we are thinking about now, the future or general time.
For example:
- If I had £1 million (now), I would buy a house (1 milyon liram olsaydi, bir ev alacaktim)
- If we went to the cinema tomorrow (future), we would see a film (yarin sinemaya girmis olsaydik, filmi gorecektik/)
- If they were American (general time), they would speak English

 **More common**
in the 2nd conditional, we can use the verb “to be“ in the past simple and say “if I was", "if you were", "if he was" etc. or
we can use “were“ for all persons and say “if I were", "if you were", "if he were" etc. The second form is perhaps more common.

 **Advice, expression, especially**
if i were you: yerinde olsam
if i were king; kral olsam

if you were a king, your wife would be called a queen

We say “If I were you” when we want to give advice to somebody, especially when we think perhaps there is a problem. For example, “If I were you, I would go to see a doctor” or “I wouldn’t open that door if I were you!”

 **3rd Conditional**

"If" + past perfect + “would have done" = **imagining in the past**

If I had gone to the park yesterday, I would have played football

We use the 3rd conditional to communicate that we are imagining something in the past that did not really happen.
 The sentence “If I had gone to the park yesterday, I would have played football“ means that,
in fact, I did not go to the park yesterday, and I did not play football; I am only imagining.

Notice that, in the 3rd conditional, we put the word “have“ and the past participle after the word “would“. For example, we say “I would have taken“; “you would have taken“; “he would have taken“ etc.

 **Mixed conditional**

Sometimes, we need to mix the 2nd conditional and 3rd conditional structures. If, for example, we imagine a situation in the past and then imagine the consequence of that in the present, we use the following structure:

“If” + past perfect + “would do/would be doing

” If I had gone to bed earlier yesterday, I would feel better now

If, on the other hand, we imagine a situation in the present and then imagine the consequence of that in the past, we use the following structure:

“If” + past + “would have done”

If my job wasn’t so demanding, I would have come to your birthday dinner last week

## 7.2 wish

 **wish **

We use the verb “wish” to communicate the idea that we would like things to be different from the way they in fact are now, or were in the past.
For example, “I wish I were a millionaire”

We must remember that the tense of any verb that follows “wish” is one step back into the past from the time that we are referring to. So, instead of the present simple tense we use the past simple tense; for example, “Maria wishes she spoke perfect English” (she doesn’t speak perfect English). Instead of the past simple tense we use the past perfect tense; for example, “Daniel wishes he had gone to the party last night” (he didn’t go to the party). Instead of the present continuous tense we use the past continuous tense; for example, “I wish it wasn’t raining” (it is raining).

 **Further uses of the verb “wish”**

We use the verb “wish” followed by the word “would” when we are unhappy or irritated about something that is happening and we want the situation to change. For example, if somebody is irritating us by making a lot of noise and we want them to be quiet, we can say “I wish he would be quiet”. If we are unhappy because it is raining and we want it to stop, we can say “I wish it would stop raining”.

In formal written English, “wish” can be followed by the infinitive with “to”, with the meaning of “want” or “would like”. For example, “I wish to complain” means “I would like to complain”.

We can also use “wish” to communicate the idea that we want something good to happen to somebody. For example, “I wished her good luck in her exam”, or “Don’t forget to wish them a pleasant journey”.



 **if only ...!**
When we want to be emphatic, we can say “if only ...!“ instead of “I wish ...“.
For example, instead of saying “I wish I could take a holiday“, we can say “If only I could take a holiday!“ Instead of
“I wish I had gone to bed earlier last night“, we can say
“If only I had gone to bed earlier last night!“

# 8 Passive

## 8.1 Active/ Passive voice

 **Active voice  :** subject does the action
 **Passive voice:** subject receive the action

In the sentence “John broke the window“, “John“ is the subject and “the window“ is the object. The verb, “broke“, is in the active voice. All the verbs we have practised up to now have been in the active voice. The active
voice communicates that the subject is active and it does the action in the sentence.

 **Atctive**
Jhon broke the window

 **Passive (subject + to be + past participle)**

The window + was +  broken by jhon
     subject    + to be + past particible

This sentence, “The window was broken by John“, has the same meaning, but the subject is now “The window“, and the verb, “was broken“, is in the passive voice. The passive voice communicates that the subject is passive; it does not do the action; it receives it.

 **“To be” + past participle**

We form the passive voice with the verb “to be“ and a past participle. The verb “to be“ communicates the time, and the past participle says what the action is. We use the word “by“ when we want to say who does the action.

In the sentence “The window was broken by John“, the word “was“ tells us that the action happened in the past, the word “broken“ tells us the action, and the words “by John“ tell us who did the action.

We must remember to put the verb “to be“ in the right form. For example, “John has eaten pasta“ becomes “Pasta has been eaten by John“.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-66_

### 8.1.1 Question words

 **When we use question words, for example “what“, “which“ and “where“, we put the preposition last in the sentence. For example, we do not say “From where do you come?“; we say “Where do you come from?“ We do not say “On what are you putting the book?“; we say “What are you putting the book on?“**

## 8.2 Uses of the passive voice

 **Uses of the passive voice**

Although the passive voice is less common than the active voice, it is very useful in certain situations.
Four common situations in which we often use the passive voice are:

1) when we don’t know who does the action: for example, “My car has been stolen!“;

2) when we don’t want to say who does the action: for example, “You were seen entering the office without permission“;

3) when it is not important who does the action: for example, “The Eiffel Tower was built in 1889“;

4) when it is obvious who does the action: for example, “He was arrested for stealing“.


_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-143_


# 9 Reported speech

## 9.1 Tell, say

The most important difference between “tell“ and “say“ is that after “tell“ we indicate the person we are speaking to, but after “say“ we usually do not.

For example:
I toldDavid that I was going on holiday.
I said that I was going on holiday.

After the verb “tell“, however, we don’t use “to“.
With direct speech, we normally use the verb “say“, and not “tell“. For example: He said “I will see you tomorrow“.
With indirect speech, we can use either “say“ or “tell“, but we must use “tell“ to report an order, not “say“. For example: He told me to go downstairs.



_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-91_

## 9.2 Direct speech and indirect speech

Direct speech and indirect speech

report
refer
inverted commas

Direct speech: I said “The room is large”
Indirect speech: I said that the room was large

- There are two ways in which we can repeat what someone has said. We
can use direct speech, and give the exact words of the speaker, like this:
Mr. Brown said "I like warm weather."

- We can also use indirect speech, and report what Mr Brown said, like this:
Mr. Brown said that he liked warm weather

- Notice that indirect speech is also called reported speech.

- When we change direct speech into indirect speech, we generally move
the verb into the past, or further into the past.
For example, we change present tenses into past tenses.

For example:
(Direct speech) The teacher said “The room is large“.
(Indirect speech) The teacher said that the room was large.

(Direct speech) The teacher said “I have drunk the coffee“.
(Indirect speech) The teacher said that he had drunk the coffee.

- If a verb is already in the past, it often remains unchanged. However,
sometimes we put it further into the past so the exact meaning is easier
to understand. Think about this sentence:

Mary said that she went to the cinema.

Here, we don’t know whether Mary said “I go to the cinema“ or “I went
to the cinema“. In other words, we don’t know if she was speaking about
a habit in the present or a single visit in the past. However, we could say
this instead:

Mary said that she had been to the cinema.

Now it becomes clearer that she was speaking about a single visit in the past.

In indirect speech, the word “will“ changes to “would“. We use “would“
when we are speaking about the past but want to refer to a future action.
For example:
(Direct speech) Mary said “John will go to
London“.
(Indirect speech) Mary said that John would go to
London.
You are reporting what Mary said in the past, but the word “would“ refers
to a future action

Notice that words like “I”, “you”, “my”, “your” etc. sometimes need to
change when direct speech becomes indirect speech.

- Notice also that for indirect speech we do not use inverted commas, and it
is not generally necessary to use the word “that“ to connect the two parts
of the sentence.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-84_

## 9.3 Direct/indirect speech

 **indirect speech with questions, imperatives and requests**

 **Questions:**
When we change a question from direct into indirect speech, we move the verb one step back into the past, we use “asked” instead of “said”, and we do not use the question form or a question mark. For example,

(Direct speech) The teacher said “What is your name?”
(Indirect speech) The teacher asked me what my name was.

If the question does not contain a question word (“what”, “where” etc.), we use the word “if” or “whether” instead. For example,

(Direct speech) I said “Are you busy, Emily?”
(Indirect speech) I asked Emily if (or whether) she was busy.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-107_

## 9.4 imperatives, command

 **imperatives, command**
When we change an imperative from direct into indirect speech, we use “told”, “commanded” or “ordered”, and we use the infinitive with “to” instead of the imperative. For example,

(Direct speech) “Sit down, children!” she said.
(Indirect speech) She told the children to sit down.

With negative imperatives, we put “not” before the infinitive. For example,
(Direct speech) “Don't walk so fast, Jack!” said Lucy.
(Indirect speech) Lucy told Jack not to walk so fast.

 **Requests**

When we change a request from direct into indirect speech, we use “asked”, and we can use the same constructions that we use for indirect questions or imperatives. For example,

(Direct speech) I said “Will you open the window, please, Daniel?”
(Indirect speech) I asked Daniel if he would open the window
. or I asked Daniel to open the window.

The first construction makes the reported request sound a little more polite, but the second construction is more common, as it is quicker.



_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-107_

# 10 some in questions

We sometimes use the words “some“, “somebody“ and “something“ in questions instead of
the usual “any“, “anybody“ and “anything“. We generally do this when we expect a positive answer, and especially when we offer something to somebody.
For example, “Would you like some more tea?“; “Is there somebody here you’re looking for?“; “Would you like me to buy you something nice for Christmas?“ etc.

 **Double contractions**
Although it is not common, we sometimes use double contractions in spoken English.
For example, instead of saying “I will have gone by tomorrow“, we can say “I’ll’ve gone by tomorrow“. Also, instead of saying “I would have done it“, we can say “I’d’ve done it“.

## 11.2 How to make a question

 **How to make a question**
To make a question with the present simple and the past simple, we use the auxiliary verb “do”.
For example, the statement “She eats too much” becomes “Does she eat too much?”, and the statement
“She bought a bicycle yesterday” becomes “Did she buy a bicycle yesterday?”
Remember that we always use an infinitive without “to” after the auxiliary verb “do”. We cannot say “Did you went?”; we must say “Did you go?”

With verbs that already contain one or more auxiliaries, we make a question by putting the subject after the first auxiliary verb.
For example, the statement “She has been eating” becomes “Has she been eating?”

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-97-99_

## 11.3 Tail questions

 **Tail questions**

- If somebody arrives home from work and they look very tired, instead of asking them “Are you feeling tired?“, we could say “You’re feeling tired, aren’t you?“ Here, we are using a tail question.

1. We usually use a tail question when we believe something is true, and we want somebody to confirm that we are right.
With this kind of question, we first say what we believe is true (for example, “You’re feeling tired“) and then we put the tail question at the end (for example, “aren’t you?“).

2.We form the tail question by repeating the first auxiliary verb from the main part of the sentence, and putting it in question form.

- If the main part of the sentence is positive, the tail question is negative.
- If the main part of the sentence is negative, the tail question is positive.

For example:
“You’re Mr Brown, aren’t you?“
“You aren’t Mr Brown, are you?“

- When there is no auxiliary verb in the main part of the sentence, we use the auxiliary verb “do“ in the tail question. For example, “You know how to cook, don’t you?“

 **to have something done**
The structure “to have something done“ communicates that we do not do the action ourselves, but that somebody else does it for us.
For example, “I do not cut my hair myself; I have my hair cut by the hairdresser“. Instead of saying “John is going to repair my computer for me“, we can say “I am going to have my computer repaired by John“.

Instead of the verb “to have“ we can use the verb “to get“. For example, “I got my hair cut yesterday“.


_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-89_

## 11.4 Short answers

Yes, I can
Yes, I would
Yes, I am
Yes, I have
Yes, I do

We can give short answers to questions simply by using an auxiliary verb.

For example:
“Can you speak Spanish?“ “Yes, I can.“
“Have you seen David?“ “No, I haven’t.“
“Will she be working?“ “Yes, she will.“

Notice that only the first auxiliary verb is necessary. Instead of “Yes, she
will be“, we can just say “Yes, she will“.

We can also make short answers with the verbs “be“ and “have“.
For example: “Are you a student?“ “Yes, I am.“
“Has he got the money?“ “Yes, he has.“

For short answers with the present simple and past simple, we use the
auxiliary “do“.
For example: “Does he eat meat?“ “Yes, he does.“
“Did they finish the job?“ “No, they didn’t.“

Of course, we don’t use short answers in the lessons because it’s important
for you to practise speaking as much as possible

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-83_

## 11.5 So would i,neither can he, nor should they

 **so would i, neither can he, nor should they**
We put the words “so”, “neither” or “nor” at the beginning of a sentence when someone makes a statement and we want to reply that the same situation is true for us or somebody else.

For example, if someone says to you “I would like to visit London”, and you would also like to visit London, as a short reply you can say “So would I” (instead of, for example, “I would too”).

In a negative sentence, if someone says to you “I can’t open this window”, and you can't open it either, you can reply “Neither can I” or “Nor can I”. There is no difference between the words “neither” and “nor”.

We make this kind of short reply by using the words “so”, “neither”, or “nor”, and by putting the auxiliary verb before the subject. For example, we say “So will I” and not “So I will”. We can also use the verbs “have” and “be”. For example, “Mary has a large house” – “So has Michael”; “He isn't a good cook” – “Neither is his wife”.

If there is no auxiliary verb, we use “do” in the short reply. For example, “He lives in this building” – “So does my sister”.

This structure is not only used as a short reply to a statement. For example, we can say “I can speak French and so can my mother”. This means the same as “I can speak French and my mother can speak French too”.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-101_


## 11.6 what and which

We generally use “which“ when we are considering a limited number of alternatives, whereas
we use “what“ in a more unlimited sense.
For example, we say “What’s your phone number?“ because there is an almost unlimited number of possibilities.
However, if we have a piece of paper with some phone numbers written on it, we say “Which of these is your phone number?“ because there is a limited number of possibilities.

 **go back**
 **come back**
 **go in**
 **come in**
 **return**
 **enter descent**
 **overcome**
 **go down**
 **come down**

Sometimes it can be difficult to know when to use the verb “go back“ and when to use “come back“, or when to use “go in“ and when to use “come in“.
Some students have a similar confusion with the words “bring“ and “take“.
The problem exists because, with these verbs, the correct choice depends mainly on where the speaker is at the time.
For example, if, at the time of speaking, I was at the school, I would say
“After the lesson tomorrow, I’ll go back home“, whereas if I were at home, I would say
“After the lesson tomorrow, I’ll come back home“.

If you really cannot decide which verb to use, one way to overcome the problem is to use the verb “return“ instead of “go back“ or “come back“, and the verb “enter“ instead of “go in“ or “come in“. However, “return“ and “enter“ are quite formal words in English, so only do this if you feel you have to.

The same difficulty exists with the verbs “go down“ and “come down“, so you can use “descend“ instead.
However, remember that using the word “descend“ sounds quite formal in English.


Do not confuse the expression “in case“ with the expression “in case of“. We use “in case of“ with the meaning of “if and when something happens“. For example, “In case of fire, leave the building immediately“ means “If and when there is a fire, leave the building immediately“.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-136_

## 11.7 Question without the question form

 **Who helped you?**

When asking a question in English, we do not always use the question form.
However, this is only when a question word, such as “who“, “what“ or “which“, is the subject in the sentence.
For example, the sentence “Who did you help?“ uses the question form because the subject is the word “you“. However, the question “Who helped you?“ doesn’t use the question form because the subject is the word “who“.

 **up, tear-tore-torn**
When we add the word “up“ to a verb, it sometimes gives it the meaning of doing the action more completely.
For example, the sentence “I broke the piece of wood“ could mean that I broke it only once, but “I broke up the piece of wood“ means that I broke it into many smaller pieces.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-138_

# 12 gerund, infinitive

- Gerund and infinitive: makes noun from verb
- Each sentences contains only one verb,
- The other words in a sentences must be noun  

 **gerund:**   fiilin sonuna "-ing" getirilerek isim yapılır.
gerund: He can't stop **smoking**

 **infinitive (mastar):**  fiilin önüne "to" getirilerek yapılır.
fiili isim fiil yapmak için oluş, kılış, duruş ifade edecek hale getirir
yap --> yapmak  (mak mastar ekidir.)
koş fiildir, koşmak fiilin ismidir. (mastar eki -mek -mak)
mean is a verb, meaning is a noun  
He allowed **to talk**  him
to do
to come (gelmek)
to go

Not: Cumlede iki fiil varsa ikiciyi ya gerunt  yada, infinitive ile isim yapariz/

 **1. Rule:  prepositions + noun**
fiilden önce preposition var ise gerund kullanılmalıdır (infinitive kullanılamaz kesinlikle)
gerund ve infinitive i ayıran nokta budur.

 **2. Rule: following verbs must be infinitive**
- Eger ikinci fiildeki eylem birinciden sonra baslayacak ise bu durumda infinitive kullaniliyor. diger durumlarda ise
gerund kullaniliryor.

he planed to go istanbul

 **- Verb + infinitive or "-ing"**

Sometimes in English, a verb is immediately followed by another verb. For example, “I enjoy swimming” or “I want to swim”. The second verb must be either an infinitive with “to” or a gerund (“-ing” form).
Some verbs, such as “promise” and “fail”, are always followed by an infinitive. For example, “The children promised to behave”, or “I failed to notice the sign above the door”.
Other verbs, such as “consider” and “finish”, are always followed by a gerund. For example, “Oliver considered taking the train”, or “Elizabeth finished reading the newspaper”.
 There is no rule to tell you which verbs are followed by an infinitive and which ones are followed by a gerund; they need to be learnt one by one.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-33-129_

## 12.1 rather, would rather, would prefer to

 **rather: oldukca**
Would you say, you spoke English rather well now?

 **would rather: tercih etmek**
 **would prefer: tercih etmek**

“Would rather“ means the same as “would prefer“. The difference is that
we put the infinitivewithout “to“ after “would rather“, whereas we put
the infinitivewith “to“ after “would prefer“.

I would preferto drink coffee
I would rather drink tea

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-79_

## 12.2 Common uses of the gerund


 **Common uses of the gerund**

Three common uses of the gerund are:

1) as a subject in a sentence: for example, “Jogging keeps me fit“;

2) after a preposition: for example, “She is good at teaching children“;

3) after certain verbs: for example, “He regrets selling his house“.



_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-150_

# 13 Nouns and Articles

- A noun is the name of a thing.
For example, “book”, “picture”, “wall“ etc. are nouns.
- The word “translate“ is a verb, whereas the word “translation“ is a noun.
- The word “mean“ is a verb, whereas the word “meaning“ is a noun.

## 13.1 Words not used in the plural

 **knowledge, progress, item, encyclopedia**

Some English nouns are never used in the plural. For example, the words “advice“, “furniture“, “information“, “knowledge“, “progress“ and “news“ do not have plural forms. We don’t say “All those informations were useful“; we say “All that information was useful“. However, we can sometimes communicate a plural idea with nouns like this by using expressions such as “pieces of“ or “items of“. For example, we can say “All those pieces of information were useful“ or “I need to buy five new items of furniture“.

 **Nouns with different forms**

 **masculine, feminine**
In English, there are a few nouns that are different depending on whether we are talking about a man or a woman.
We call these nouns “masculine“ if they refer to a man and “feminine“ if they refer to a woman.

We can sometimes form a feminine noun from a masculine noun by adding the letters “ess“.

actor - actress
host - hostess
prince - princess
waiter - waitress
god - goddess

Other examples of masculine and feminine nouns are as follows:
nephew - niece
landlord - landlady
widower - widow


 **Using nouns in general sense**

In the sentence “Dogs hate cats“, we are not speaking about specific dogs or cats. We mean dogs generally and cats generally.

When we use nouns in the general sense, we put them in the plural and we do not put an article (“a“, “an“ or “the“) in front of them. For example, “Schools educate children“ or “Machines help people do jobs“. If a noun does not have a plural form, we simply use it on its own, also without an article. For example, “Bread is commonly eaten with butter“ or “Blood is red“.

 **frequent (verb) frequent (adjective) frequently (adverb)**
The word “frequent“ is a verb, whereas the word “frequent“ is an adjective.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-117-118_

## 13.2 Plural and singular nouns

 **Each:**  is a singular
We say “each student is sitting”, not “each student are sitting” – the word “each“ is singular.

 **every:** is a singular
The word “every” is similar to “all” but it is singular.
We say “all the chairs **are**  red”, but we say “every chair **is**  red”.

 **one of the:**
After the words “one of the ...“, we use a plural noun.
For example, “Paris is one of the largest **cities**  in Europe“.

## 13.3 infinitive and gerund



 **# verb + to**

Some verbs require an **infinitive** in the complement.

afford
arrange
deserve
hope
offer
threaten
agree
aim
attempt
decide
fail
forget
learn
manage
plan
promise
.....


(ex) He decided to study in USA.(ex) How old were you when you learnt to play golf?

 **# verb + ...ing**
 ****
Some verbs require an **-ing** form in the complement.


admit
delay
finish
miss
stop
avoid
deny
imagine
practice
enjoy
consider
fancy
involve
postpone ....

(ex) Have you considered studying in another country?
(ex) I enjoyed talking with my friend.

Some **verb phrases** require an **-ing** form in the complement.

 approve of
forget about
look forward to
be better off
get through
object to
count on
insist on
think of

(ex) How about going to China when you get through studying?
(ex) I looked forward to meeting my old friend.

## 13.4 The, a

 **The: Definite article**
 **A, an: Indefinite article**

-  We always use "the" or "a, an" before nouns in English

- Isimden once "a" yada "the" kullanilacagina karar veremediysen su yontemi kullan
a= one,  the=that, kelimelerini koyarsan manali bir cumle oluyorsa onu kullanirsin.
i'am staying ... hotel in londan (one=a)
Close .... door, please (that=the)

- The articles in English are “the“, “a“ and “an“. We call the word “the“ the definite article, and we call the words “a“ and “an“ the indefinite articles.
For example:  A pen, the pen (dı pen),  An apple, the apple (di epıl)

The plural of “a“ is “some“. For example, we say “a pen”, but “some pens”
What's the plural of "a"? The plural of "a" is "some"
What's the plural of "a book"? The plural of "a book" is "some books"

 **Exceptions:**
1. We don't use "a" or "the"when we use my, your, etc. (my pen, your pen, possessive pronouns)
2. We don't use "a" or "the" before people and place names (Is she **Anna Brown** ? No she isn't **Anna Brown**  it's Jack Brown) Queen Elizabeth lives in **London**

 **"A" or "An": Indefinite article**
1. The indefinite articles “a” and “an” mean the same as “one“, and we use them with **singular countable nouns** .
For example, we say “a chair“, “an apple“ etc. We do not use them with uncountable nouns like “bread“, “water“ etc.

2. Another use of the indefinite article “a” is when we talk about **people’s jobs** . For example, we say “She wants to becomea doctor”, or “He works asa waiter”.

3. Sometimes, we use the word “one“ instead of the indefinite article, but only when we **need to emphasize the number** .
For example, “I have two sisters but only one brother“, or “There’s just one problem with your idea of going to the cinema; we have no money“.
 If we do not need to emphasize the number, we use the indefinite article.
For example, “I went toa really good restaurant last night“, or “He isanartist“

4. The difference between “a“ and “an“ is that we use “a“ before a consonant sound whereas we use “an“ before a vowel sound.
For example, we say “a book“ because the word “book“ starts with the sound /b/, a consonant sound. We say “an apple“ because the word “apple“ starts with the sound /æ/, a vowel sound..
The noun “use“ starts with the letter “u“, a vowel, but it starts with the sound /j/, a consonant sound. Therefore, we say “the /ðə/ use“ and not “the /ði:/ use“.
Remember, some words that begin with the letter “h” start with a vowel sound, because the “h” is silent. For example, we say “an hour“ and not “a hour“.

 **"The": Definite article**
The most important use of the definite article “the” is when we are referring to something specific that **is known to both the speaker and the listener.**  This is similar to the way that we use the words “this”, “that”, “these” or “those”. For example, “The teacher we had last week has left”, or “John’s got a new house; the garden’s lovely”, or “The sun rose early today”.

There are three other special uses of the definite article “the” that we should remember:

1) We can sometimes use the word “the” **to speak about things in general** , but only when we are speaking about types of animals or types of things.
For example,
instead of saying “Tigers are dangerous animals”, we can say “The tiger is a dangerous animal”.
This doesn’t refer to one specific tiger, but to tigers in general.
Instead of saying “Computers are very useful things”, we can say “The computer is a very useful thing”. This means computers in general.

2) We sometimes put the definite article “the” in front of a name, but only when it is the **name of a river, sea, ocean or mountain chain** . For example “the Thames”, “the Mediterranean”, “the Atlantic”, “the Alps” etc.

3) Finally, we occasionally put the word “the” in front of the name of a country, but only if the name is plural in form. For example, “ **the Netherlands** ”, “ **the United States of America** ” etc. With country names that are singular in form, we do not use “the”. For example, we say “France” (not “the France”).

- The indefinite article “a“ (or “an“) is used when we use a noun for the first time. If we then **refer to the same thing or person again** , we normally use the definite article “the”.
For example: “Yesterday, I receiveda letter andan email. I haven’t readthe letter yet, but I have readthe email“.

We sometimes use the definite article “the“ when we use a noun for the first time, but only when the speaker and the listener both know who or what is being talked about.
For example:
“Ah, Doctor Jones. Good morning. The woman who phoned yesterday has arrived for her appointment.” Here, it is clear which woman we are talking about – the woman who phoned yesterday.

 **“The” + adjective = noun**

Sometimes, we can use an adjective as a noun by putting the definite article “the” before the adjective.
For example, instead of saying “young people”, we can say “the young”.
- A noun formed in this way is always plural and takes a plural verb.

We can do the same thing with certain nationalities.
For example, instead of “English people” we can talk about “the English”.
This can be done with adjectives ending in “sh“, “ch“, “ese“ or “ss“.
For example, “the Spanish“, “the French“, “the Chinese“, “the Swiss” etc.

## 13.5 making verb

 **dark – darken**
 **short – shorten**

We can form verbs from certain adjectives or nouns by adding the letters
“en“. For example, from the adjective “dark“ we can make the verb
“to darken“, which means “to make darker“ or “to get darker“. Other
examples are “short – shorten“, “wide – widen“ etc.


An adjective or noun must have only one syllable in order for us to form a
verb from it. There are also some one-syllable adjectives and nouns from
which we cannot form a verb. We can’t say, for example, “to smallen“; we
say “to make smaller“

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-85_

## 13.6 Noun (or pronoun) + infinitive with “to”

When a noun (or pronoun) is followed by an infinitive with “to“, it is similar to a relative clause.
For example, “I have a lot of work to do“ means the same as “I have a lot of work that I must do“.
The sentence “There is nothing in the fridge for us to eat“ means “There is nothing in the fridge that we can eat“.

 **it's time ...**
If we use an infinitive after the expression “it’s time“ and say, for example, “It’s time (for us) to eat“, it means that now is the proper or correct time to eat; maybe we are at work and our lunch break starts now. However, if we use the past tense after “it’s time“ and say, for example, “It’s time we ate“, it means that we are a little late; maybe our lunch break will finish quite soon and we need to hurry. Notice that, although we are using the past tense, “ate“, we are not speaking about the past; we are talking about a situation in the present.

 **fine, superior**

The word “fine“ can mean “of very good or superior quality“. For example, we can say “a fine football player“ or “fine gold“. It can also mean “delicate“, “thin“ or “small“, as in “fine cotton“ or “fine detail“.

 **hollow, solid**
If an object is hollow, it has empty space inside it, so it is not solid. For example, a tennis ball is hollow, whereas a golf ball is solid.

 **represent, representative**
One meaning of the verb “to represent“ is “to symbolize“. For example, we can say “The cross on the map represents my house“. Another meaning is “to act in the place of“. For example, “The Queen was represented at the ceremony by her cousin“.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-148_

## 13.7 "Any” and “some” with singular countable nouns

 **"Any” and “some” with singular countable nouns**

When we use the word “any“ in front of a singular countable noun, it means “it’s not important which“.
For example, the sentence “Take any biscuit you like“ means that it isn’t important which biscuit you take; you can choose whichever one you like.

When we use “some“ in front of a singular countable noun, we are referring to a particular person or thing, butwe don’t know (orwe don’t want to say) who it is or which it is.
For example, in the sentence
“Some man came to see you this morning while you were out“, we are referring to a particular man, but we can’t remember or don’t know who it was.

# 14 Pronouns and Determiners

## 14.1 Reflexive pronouns

 **myself,**
 **yourself,**
 **himself,**
 **herself, itself, oneself,**
 **ourselves,**
 **ourselves,**
 **themselves**

We use a reflexive pronoun when the subject and object are the same person or thing.
“The teacher taught me”, the subject and the object are different people.
“I taught myself”, the subject and the object are the same person.
Consequently, we use the reflexive pronoun “myself” as the object.

i taught myself: myself as the object

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-68_

## 14.2 Emphasizing pronouns

Sometimes, we use the words “myself”, “yourself”, “himself” etc. when we want to emphasize information about who does the action in a particular sentence. For example, the difference between the sentences “John cooked the meal” and “John cooked the meal himself” is that the second sentence emphasizes that it was John who cooked the meal and not someone else. In this sentence, we call the word “himself” an emphasizing pronoun. Notice that the emphasizing pronouns are the same words as the reflexive pronouns.

Sometimes we use an emphasizing pronoun with the meaning of “alone” or “without any help”, in which case we generally put the word “by” in front of it. For example, “I did the translation myself” emphasizes the fact that I did the translation and not someone else, whereas “I did the translation by myself” means that I did the translation alone, without any help.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-109_

# 15 Relative clauses

## 15.1 Relative clauses, Relative pronouns

 **- Relative clauses (1) :**
I have a **black cat (adjective)**
I have a cat **which is black (relative clause)**

The sentences “I have a black cat” and “I have a cat which is black” have the same meaning.
In the second sentence, the clause “which is black” is called a relative clause, and, like the adjective “black” in the first sentence,
it is telling us about the noun “cat”.
-So, an adjective is a word that we use to describe a noun, and
-a relative clause is a clause that we use to describe a noun.

 **Relative pronouns:**
We put a relative clause immediately after the noun it describes, and it usually starts with a word like“who”,“which” or“that”. We call these words relative pronouns. In the sentence “Here is my house, which I love very much”, the relative pronoun “which” relates to (or means) “my house”, so the clause “which I love very much” means “I love my house very much”.

The difference between “who”, “which” and “that” is that we use “who” for people, “which” for things and animals, and “that” for people, things and animals.

 **- Relative clause (2)**
 **defining clause**
There are two types of relative clause: defining clauses and non-defining clauses.

Defining clauses identify (or define) which person or thing we are talking about.
 For example:
My brother who lives in France is rich.

This means I have more than one brother, and the clause “who lives in France” identifies which one of my brothers I am talking about. It is a defining clause because, without it, you do not know which person I mean. stream upstream downstream on fire
Non-defining clauses do notidentify a person or thing, but simply give us extra information about them.
For example:
My mother, who lives in France, is rich. In this sentence, the clause “who lives in France” is a non-defining clause because it does not identify the person I am talking about. It is simplyextra information about my mother. Notice that a non-defining clause is separated from the main part of the sentence by commas.

- We can use the relative pronoun “that” instead of “who” or “which” in defining clauses; we cannot use “that” in non-defining clauses.
For example:
The womanthat works in the library is very tall
The trainthat leaves at 6 p.m. is always full
but
London,which is the capital of England, is very large.


 **Relative clause (3)**
We have already learned a lot about relative clauses, but here are a few more things that we should know.

 **what:**
- We use the relative pronoun “what” instead of “which” or “that”
when we don’t mention the thing that the relative clause describes.
For example, instead of saying
“She showed methe dress which she had bought”, we can say
“She showed mewhat she had bought”.

 **whom: (formal)**
- With formal English, some people prefer to use the relative pronoun “whom” instead of “who”.
However, this is only possible when the relative pronoun is not the subject of the verb that follows.
In the sentence “I recognized the criminal who stole the bag”, the word “who” is the subject of the verb “stole“; in this sentence, we cannot use “whom“.
However, in the sentence “I recognized the criminal who the policeman arrested”, the word “who” is not the subject of the verb “arrested“; “the policeman” is the subject and “who” is the object. In this case, some people prefer to use the word “whom“ instead of “who“ and say
“I recognized the criminal whom the policeman arrested“. In informal English, however, the word “whom“ is never used.

In very formal English, we sometimes have a preposition at the beginning of a relative clause, and in this case we cannot follow the preposition with the word “who“; we must use “whom” instead. For example, “She is the lady with whom I had a conversation”, or “The manager to whom I sent the document has not replied”. (Remember, however, that in normal spoken English we put the preposition at the end, and say “She’s the lady who I had a conversation with”, or “The manager who I sent the document to hasn’t replied”.)

 **whose**
We use the word “whose” at the beginning of a relative clause instead of using a possessive adjective like “my”, “your”, “his” etc. For example, instead of saying “I have a dog. Its tail is long”, we can say “I have a dog whose tail is long”. Instead of saying “Yesterday I visited Mr Jones. I work with his sister”, we can say “Yesterday I visited Mr Jones, whose sister I work with”.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-101_

## 15.2 Preparatory

 **Preparatory "it"**
it is + adjective + infinitive with "to"

A preparatory “it” is when we use the word “it” at the beginning of a sentence to prepare us for information that comes later in the sentence.
For example, in the sentence
“It's unhealthy to drink a lot of coffee”, the word “it” refers to the information “to drink a lot of coffee”, and so the sentence means the same as “Drinking a lot of coffee is unhealthy”. The sentence “It's nice to eat in a restaurant” means the same as “Eating in a restaurant is nice”.

With a preparatory “it”, we generally use the structure “It is” + adjective + infinitive with “to”. For example, “It is not very easy to speak a foreign language well”.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-103_

# 16 Adjectives

 **Using nouns as adjectives**
We can often use a noun as an adjective in English simply by putting it immediately before another noun, as in the expression “train station“. When we do this, the word “train“ becomes an adjective to describe the noun “station“. For example, a shoe shop is a shop; the word “shoe“ tells us what it sells. A book cover is a cover for a book.

Sometimes, these expressions are used so often that they eventually become one word. For example, “ashtray“, “bedroom“, “toothbrush“ etc.


 **Compound adjectives**

Sometimes, words can be put together to make compound adjectives. For example, a child that behaves well can be called “a well-behaved child“. The phrase “well-behaved“ is a compound adjective.

One common way of making compound adjectives is by putting an adverb or adjective together with a participle. For example, a wedding that has been planned badly could be called “a badly planned wedding”.

Sometimes, we make compound adjectives by putting an adjective together with a noun that has the letters “ed“ after it. For example, a girl with long hair can be called a long-haired girl.

- Another common type of compound adjective in English is when, instead of saying “The lesson lasted for fifty minutes“, we say “It was a fifty- minute lesson“, or instead of saying “This car has four doors“, we say “This is a four-door car“. In these examples, “fifty-minute“ and “four- door“ are compound adjectives.

 **a fifty-minute lesson**
 **a four-door car**

With these adjectives, notice that the word after the number is singular, not plural. For example, we say “a twenty-page document“, not “a twenty-pages document“. This is because the word “page“ is being used as an adjective in this phrase, and adjectives in English do not have plural forms.

 **Adjective + infinitive with “to”**
When an adjective is followed by an infinitive with “to“, it often communicates our feelings or reactions to a particular event.
For example, “I was surprised to hear the news“ means that the news surprised me. The sentence “I’ll be happy to help you“ means that helping you will make me feel happy.





_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-127_

## 16.1 Comparatives, Superlatives

 **Comparative (-er)**
- "-er" for one syllable, cheap-cheaper than- the cheapest
- "more" for more than one syllable, expensive-more expensive than - the most expensive

 **Superlative (-est)**
- "-est" for one syllable, cheap-cheaper than- the cheapest
- "the most" for more than one syllable, expensive, more expensive, the most expensive.

When an adjective has one syllable, like “cheap“, we make the comparative by adding the letters “er“ and we say “cheaper than“. We make the superlative by adding the letters “est“ and we say “the cheapest“.

When an adjective has three syllables, like “expensive“, we do not add “er“; instead, we make the comparative by using the word “more“, and we say “more expensive than“. For the superlative, we do not add “est“. Instead, we use the word “most“ and we say “the most expensive“.

 **Comparatives and superlatives of adjectives, participles and adverbs**
Most adjectives of two syllables which have the stress on the first syllable form their comparatives and superlatives by adding “-er” and “-est”. For example, “clever – cleverer – cleverest” and “simple – simpler – simplest”.

However, adjectives ending in “-ful” or “-less” form their comparatives and superlatives by using “more than” and “the most”. For example, “helpful – more helpful – the most helpful” and “careless – more careless – the most careless”.

Some adjectives are made from the participles of verbs. For example, “a surprising result” or “an interested child”. These adjectives form their comparatives and superlatives by using “more than” and “the most”. For example, “boring – more boring – the most boring” and “pleased – more pleased – the most pleased”.

There are some exceptions to these rules, but if you are not sure how to form the comparative and superlative of an adjective, it is best to use “more than” and “the most”.

Adverbs that are made by adding “-ly” to an adjective form their comparatives and superlatives by using “more than” and “the most”. For example, “carefully – more carefully – the most carefully”.


 **Small / Little**
Generally, we use “small“ instead of “little“ to form the comparative and superlative; we say “smaller“ and “smallest“ and not “littler“ and “littlest“, because they are easier to pronounce.


 **Comparatives: big and small differences**

As we know, comparative forms are used to communicate that there is a difference between two people or things.
For example, when we say to somebody “John is taller than David“, they understand there is a difference in height.
However, they do not know how big the difference is. If we want to communicate this information, we need to put other words before the comparative.

To communicate that the difference is very big, we can put words such as “much”, “far” or “a lot“ before the comparative, and say, for example, “John is far taller than David“. To communicate that the difference is very small, we can use words such as “slightly”, “a little” or “a bit”, and say, for example, “John is slightly taller than David“.

If we want to emphasize a superlative, we can use the words “by far”. For example, “She is by far the tallest member of her family”.


 **Better than**
- Do you speak English better than Turkish?

- cheaper ... than
is a rolls roys cheaper than haci murat
- more expensive... than
is your handkerchief more expensive than your shoes?

 **the best, the worst**
 **----**
 **as high as**
is the table as high as the door (onun gibi, onun kadar)

 **“as many as” and “as much as”**
- We use “as many as” and “as much as” with nouns.
For example, “I’ve got as many fingers on my left hand as on my right“, and “I eat as much meat as bread“.
- We use “as many ... as“ with things we can count, and “as much ... as“ with things we cannot count.

as many ... as,  as much .... as
many: countable
much: uncountable

do you drink as much fruit juice as water?
do you thing you read as many books as your father?

 **either ....or :**  her ikisinden biri, hangisinin olduğu çok önemli değil
if she wants something to eat, where must she go --> if she wants something to eat she must go either home or restaurant

 **near, far from, further than, farther than**
near: yanında
far from: uzağında

nearer ... than,
further ... than
farter ... than

is Japan near England? it's far from England

the nearest: en yakın
the farthest: en uzak
the furthest: en uzak

 **earlier... than, the earliest**
------

 **- Both: **
- We use “both“ for two people or things.
Both my hands are on the table. Both of us are in the room. We aren’t both sitting; you’re sitting, but I’m standing.

- We can say “both chairs” or “both of the chairs” but, with the words “us”, “you” and “them”, we say “both **of**  us/you/them” and not “both us/you/them”.
Which is it right to say: "both us" or "both **of**  us"
Are both my hands on the table?
are both these books are open  

- objeler için her iki kullanım olabiliyor.
 both chairs - yada
 both of the chairs

- Do  we use our mouth for both eating and speaking? - yes we use our mouth for both speaking and eating.
can you speak both english and Spanish? no i can't speak both english and Spanish? i speak only Turkish.

- fakat zamirler için kullanıldığında us,you,them için of kullanılmalıdır.
both of us/you/them,   şeklinde kullanılır. both us/you/them şeklinde kullanılmaz.

 **one .. the other**
are both my hands are on the table?  No both your hands aren't on the table,
One's on the table and the others on your arm

 **That one:**
Instead of saying “This pencil is black and that pencil is white“, we can say “This pencil is black and that one is white“, without repeating the word “pencil“.

## 16.2 Possessive adjectives-Poseessive pronouns

 **Adjectives**
The words “black“, “white“, “large“, “small“, “high“, “low“ etc. are adjectives. In English, we put adjectives before or after a nouns.

 **Possessive  adjectives (iyelik, sahiplik)**

my
your
his
her
its
our
your
their

 **Possesive pronouns (zamir)**

mine
yours
his
hers
ours
yours
theirs

 **Possessive adjectives - Possessive pronouns**

my - mine
your - yours
his - his
her - hers
its -
our - ours
your - yours
their - theirs


is this ear yours - no, that ear isn't mine, it's yours
is that nose mine? - no this nose isn't yours, it's mine

is that dress his? - no, that dress isn't his it's hers
are those legs ours? - No, that suit isn't hers, it's his

is this ear yours - no, that ear isn't mine, it's yours
is that nose mine? - no this nose isn't yours, it's mine

is that dress his? - no, that dress isn't his it's hers
are those legs ours? - No, that suit isn't hers, it's his

The difference between a possessive adjective and a possessive pronoun is that we put a possessive adjective in front of a noun
(for example, “This is my book“), whereas we use a possessive pronoun instead of a noun.
For example, instead of saying “This is my pen and that is her pen”, we can say “This is my pen and that is hers”.

# 17 Adverbs

## 17.1 Adverbs formed from adjectives

 **Adverbs formed from adjectives**

As you have already seen, one very common way of forming adverbs is by adding the letters “ly“ to the adjective. For example, “careful – carefully“; “dangerous – dangerously“; “useless – uselessly“ etc.
bad badly;
quick quickly
etc.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-77_

## 17.2 Adverbs of frequency

Some common adverbs of frequency are:“never”, “rarely”, “occasionally”, “sometimes”, “often”, “usually” and “always”. These adverbs normally go after the first auxiliary verb. For example, “I have never been to Australia” or “He will always love her”.

If there is no auxiliary verb, these adverbs normally go directly before the verb. For example, “They rarely go to the theatre” or “Steve usually drinks beer”.

If the verb is negative, these adverbs normally go after the word “not”. For example, “He has not often spoken to us” or “I haven’t always had long hair”.

There are some other adverbs, such as “also” and “even”, which usually go in the same position as adverbs of frequency. For example, “I have also been reading that book” or “Sophie can speak several languages; she even speaks Chinese”.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-106_

# 18 Conjunctions and prepositions

 **Conjunction:**  is a word that joins clauses together to make long sentences.
Some common conjunctions are words like “and”, “because”, “but”, “so” and “if”.
The sentence “You can borrow my car” has only one clause.
The sentence “You can borrow my car if you promise to be careful” contains two clauses, and they are joined together by the conjunction “if”.


## 18.1 Preposition (on,under,in,from etc.)

 **Putting prepositions at last in questions**

-  When we use question words, for example **“what“** , **“which“**  and ** “where“** , we put the preposition last in the sentence.
For example,
we do not say “From where do you come?“;
we say “Where do you comefrom?“ i come from Turkey
We do not say “On what are you putting the book?“;
we say “What are you putting the bookon?“

what do we speakwith?  - we speak with our mouse
where am i taking the bookfrom?  you're taking the book from table
what am i putting the penunder? you're putting the pen under the book
what are you sittingon? i'm sitting on the chair



_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-15-17_

## 18.2 in spite of/ despite

 **in spite of, despite**

“In spite of” and “despite” both mean the same as “although”, but they are prepositions, so we put nouns after them.

There are three ways of using “in spite of” or “despite”. They can be followed by a noun, or “-ing”, or “the fact that ...”.
For example:
In spite of her illness, she went to work.
Despite being ill, she went to work.
In spite of the fact that she was ill, she went to work.

It is important to remember that “in spite of“ and “despite“ cannot be followed immediately by a subject and verb.
For example, we cannot say “In spite of she was ill, she went to work”.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-72_

# 19 Phrasal verbs

 **Phrasal verb**

The English language contains many phrasal verbs. A phrasal verb is a phrase consisting of a verb with one or two other words after it. The meaning of a phrasal verb is often not clear at all from simply looking at the verb. One example of this is “give up”, meaning to stop a habit. The meaning has no obvious connection with the idea of giving – you need to learn it separately. Other examples of phrasal verbs are “get along with”, meaning to have a good relationship with someone, and “set up”, meaning to start an organization.

In Stage 11 of the Callan Method, there are a lot of common phrasal verbs. You should learn them in exactly the same way that you would learn any other word or expression in the language. Do not waste time trying to  nd a connection between the meaning of the verb and the meaning of the phrasal verb.

Word pool1
doll knuckle tram glove calendar fringe spark fountain chapter pirate cable tractor peach moustache diagram

 **may well, might well, could well**
When we put the word “well” immediately after the modals “may”, “might” or “could”, it changes their meaning from “perhaps” to “probably”.

 **- At the beginning of, at the end of**
What do i say to you at the beginning of the lesson

 **"make somebody do ...."   --> "make"**

In the construction “make somebody do ...“, the word “make“ means “force“ or “cause“.
For example,
“The teacher made me correct my dictation“ means that he forced me to correct my dictation.
The sentence “Sunny weather makes me feel happy“ means that it causes me to feel happy.

in the construction "make somebody do ...", the word "make" means
"force" or "cause".

The teacher **made**   me correct my dictation  ( **force)**
Sunny weather **makes**   me feel happy **(cause)**


 **a few, few**

The difference between "a few" and "few" is that
"a few" simply means "not many", whereas "few" often express the idea of "not enough"
or "fewer than expected".
If somebody says that they have a few friend, they mean "not many, but some"
they are probably happy with the number of friends they have.
However, if somebody says that they have few friend, they mean that they don't have enough friends
and that they would like more.
if we say "There were few people at the party last night", we mean that
there were not enough people at the party, or that there were fewer people than we had expedted.

 **a little, little**

The difference between "a little" and "little" is the same as that "a few" and "few"

"A little" simply means "not much", whereas "little" often express the idea of "not enough" or "less
than expected".
If somebody says that they have a little money, they mean "not much, but some"
they probably have enough. However,
If somebody says that they have little money, they mean that they don't have enough money and
that they need more.
If we say "There has been little rain this month", we mean that there has been less rain than we expected.



 **"too look at", "to watch"**
- The difference between “to look at“ and “to watch“ is that we use “to look at“ for something that is still, whereas we use “to watch“ for something that is moving.
For Example
I'm looking at your hand (still)
I'm watching your hand  (moving)

 **a Country**  is nation
 **the country**  is opposite of town
When we say “the country“, we often mean “the countryside“. However, another meaning of “the country“ is “the people of a nation“.
For example, we can say “The country rejoiced at the news of the victory“, or “The country voted to change the government“.


 **by the sea:** deniz kenadı
 **inland:**  kara içinde
 **mediterranian:** akdeniz.

 **beside:**  yanında
 **besides:** yanı sıra

 **on: ** tamamamen kaplamadan üzerinde olmak

We say “over“ when there is no contact between the two objects. For example, my right hand is over the pen, and my left hand is over the table.
When there is contact between the two objects, we say “over“ when one object covers the other completely, and “on“ when it does not cover it completely. For example, now, my right hand is over the pen, but my left hand is on the table.

 **quick... slow**
The word “quick“ is an adjective, whereas the word “quickly“ is an adverb. For example, we say “He is a quick thinker; he thinks quickly”, or “He is a slow writer; he writes slowly“.

 **Possessive case for people's homes**
Instead of saying “I'm going to John's house tomorrow”, we can simply say “I'm going to John's” tomorrow.

 **here you are**
 **there he is**

We use the expression “Here you are“ when we hand something to
somebody. For example, if you say “Can I borrow your book, please?“, I
can reply “Yes, of course you can; here you are“.

When we …, we can say “Here you are“
We also use this same structure with the words “here“ or “there“ in other
situations. For example, when we are trying to find a particular person
and we suddenly see them, we can say “Ah, here you are!“, or when we
are pointing somebody out in a photograph, we can say “There he is“


 **ever/never**
The word “ever“ is positive, and is generally used in questions, whilst the word “never“ is negative.

 **to talk .... to speak**
The verb “to talk” means “to speak”; we can speak to somebody about something, or we can talk to somebody about something. However, we must say “I speak English” and not “I talk English”.

 **How are you? / How are you doing? / How's it going?**
When we meet a friend, we can say “Hi“ and then “How are you?“, “How’s it going?“ or “How are you doing?“ When we meet somebody for the first time, we can say “Hello. Nice to meet you“, and shake hands with them.

 **bring/take**
The difference between “bring“ and “take“ is that “bring“ means “carry here“ whereas “take“ means “carry there“. When you come to school, you bring your book with you. When you go home after the lesson, you take your book with you.

 **road, street**
The difference between a road and a street is that a road is generally in the country and connects two towns, whereas a street is in a town and generally has shops in it. A road can also be in the town but, if it is, it generally has no shops.

 **Get (Become, Receive, Obtain, Fetch)**

We use the word “get“ a lot in English, and it has different meaning

- The word “get“ means “become“ when it has an adjective after it.
For example, “I am getting hungry“ means “I am becoming hungry“.

When you get hungry, what do you do? When I get hungry, I eat
Do you thing your English is getting better? Yes, I think my  English is getting better

- When we put a noun after “get“, it can mean “receive“, “obtain“ or “fetch“

About how much does doctor get (receive) a month? a doctor gets about .....$ a month.
Do you get (receive) any cards from your friends on your birthday?

 **Get to (Arrive, Reach)**

- If we “get to“ a place, it means we arrive (or reach) there.
What time do you generally get to school for your lesson? (arrive at)

What time do you generally get (arrive)

- The verb “get“ has other meanings besides the ones here, but its general meanings are “become“ (before an adjective) and “obtain“ (before a noun).
- If you are not sure when to use “get“, it is better to use the other verb with the same meaning. For example, instead of saying “I get many emails“ you can say “I receive many emails“.

 **Home, Here, There**
- Before the words “home“, “here“ and “there“, we do not use the word “to“. For example, “I get here at 11 a.m. for my lesson and go home again at 1 p.m.“.

 **- worth + Ving**
 If we say that something is ‘worth doing’, we mean that it is better to do it than not do it.
For example, if you live in a very rainy country, it isworth buying an umbrella.
If you live in a very sunny country, it is notworth buying an umbrella.

Do you think it'sworth paying losts of money for clothes? Yes, I think it’s worth paying lots of money for clothes ~ No, I don’t think it’s worth paying lots of money for clothes

Do you thing it's worth studying the language of another country?

 **- in a x month's time**
The opposite of “3 months ago“ is “in 3 months’ time“.
3 month's ago = past 3 months
in 3 month's time= in next 3 month's
Where will you be in 6 months' time?
Will we be here in 3 weeks' time?

 **- Succeed / Fail**

For example, we say “ **succeed in going** “, “succeed in taking“ etc.
- i succeeded in answering the last question
- you'll succeed in learning English.

- **use: kullanma(fiil), kullanim(isim)**

What's the use of a pen? the use of a pen is for writing
What's the use in studying languages? (noun)
The use in studying languages is to make it possible for us to speak to people from other countries (noun)


 **- Too many, too much**
“Too many” and “too much” mean an excessive number or quantity, and therefore not a good thing. We use “too many” and “too much” with nouns, but with adjectives and adverbs we only use the word “too”.
For example, we say “too many cars” and “too much food”, but we say “too short” and “too quickly”.
We can also use “too much” after a verb. For example, “If I eat too much, I feel bad

 **“Find” + somebody/something + adjective**
Instead of saying “I think English is easy”, we can say “I find English easy”.
Instead of “I think John is impolite”, we can say “I find John impolite”.

 **"Make" + somebody/something + adjective**
What kind of things make you angry?
The kind of things make me angry are when things go wrong,
when people are making too much noise etc.

 **between, among**
The difference between “between“ and “among“ is that we generally use “between“ for two people or things, whereas we use “among“ for more than two people or things. For example, “Between the two subjects of history and geography, I prefer geography“, and “Among all the subjects I study (or studied) at school, I like (or liked) science the most“.

 **each other / one another**
I am looking at you, and you are looking at me. We are looking at each other.
I am looking at you, you are looking at me, I am looking at him, he is looking at me etc.
We are looking at one another. We generally use “each other“ for two people or things, and “one another“ for more than two people or things.

 **Whether**
The word “whether“ means the same as “if“. We usually use “whether” when we have a doubt and say, for example, “I don’t know whether it’ll rain tomorrow” or “Can you tell me whether he is in his office, please?“ or “I can’t decide whether it’s a good idea to go there“.

We also use “whether“ when two possible actions have the same result. For example, if I go to France for my holiday, I will have a good time. Also, if I go to Spain for my holiday, I will have a good time. Therefore, I can say “Whether I go to France or Spain for my holiday, I will have a good time”.

 **great**
The word ‘”great” generally means “very good” but it can sometimes mean “big” or “important”. For example, “That film is great” means “That film is very good”, but when we speak about “the Great Lakes“ in North America, we mean that they are very big, and when we say that somebody is “a great man”, we generally mean that they are important in public life.

 **fast**
“Fast“ means the same as “quick” or “quickly”; it is both an adjective and an adverb. We do not add “ly“ to it. We say “He writes fast“, and not “He writes fastly“.

 **Just**
The word “just” can mean “a short time ago” and it can also mean “simply” or “only”.


 **still, yet, in progress**
Web use "still" for something that is in progress at the moment, whereas
we use "yet" for that has not begun or happened (gecmis zaman kullanilarak anlatildi)

it is still winter; it isn't spring yet.
it is still Monday; it isn’t Tuesday yet

We generally use “still” in positive sentences, whereas we generally use “yet” in questions and negative sentences,
but not always. We must learn when to use “still“ and when to use “yet“ by practice.

 **although: oldoo (oldugu halde)**
Although the food was not very nice, i ate it because i was hungry

 **Even : bile**
The word “even“ can have a similar meaning to “also“, but we use it when the next piece of information is surprising.

even kelimesi ile also arasindaki fark, su
even kullanirsak sonraki cumle dinleyici icin bir supriz icerir
She speak Russian, German, French, and even Chinese
He was very impolite: he didn't even say "hello"

 **plenty of** : yeterinden fazla (more than enough)

 **get in, get out of, get on, get off:**
get in  : we get in a car, but we get on a bus
get out of : we get out of a car, but we get off a bus
get on
get off
We get in/into a car, but we get on/onto a bus, a train, a plane or a ship. We get out of a car, but we get off a bus, a train, a plane or a ship.
If we say “John lives on pasta“, we mean that John only eats pasta.

 **Would you say (do you think)** : ask somebody for his/her opinion about something
NOT: would you say, den sonra pas tense gelir.
what would you say was the best way to remember something
We use the expression “would you say“ when we ask somebody for his opinion about something. It means “Do you think ... ?“
Notice that we use the past tense after “would you say“, because it is part of a conditional construction.

 **purpose (to see = in order to see = so that)**
The most common way to communicate purpose in English is by using the infinitive with “to“.
For example, the sentence “I went to the hospitalto see a doctor“ tells us the purpose of going to the hospital.
With formal English, it is more common to use “in order to“. For example, we would say “I visited the hospital in order to see a doctor“.

We can also use “so that“ to communicate purpose. For example, “She shut the door so that the cat could not go into the garden“.

 **point at, point out**
We use “point at“ for the action of pointing the finger at an object.
For example, “I’m pointing at that picture“.
However, “ **to point out** “ means to indicate something among different things. For example, “He pointed out the mistakes in my dictation“.

 **may, might**
The words “may“ and “might“ both express the idea of “perhaps“, but we cannot use “may“ in the 2nd conditional. For example, we cannot say “If I was rich, I may buy a big house “; we must say “I might buy“ instead. (2nd Conditional: “If + past + “would do” = only imagining )

 **arrive at, arrive in**
We arrive at a point, like a building or a station, whereas
we arrive in an area, like a city or a country.

 **Verb + Back**
When we add the word “back“ to a verb it means “to return“.
For example, “give back“, “go back“, “pay back“ etc.


 **mad, crazy**
The word “mad“ has three common meanings: angry, very interested, and crazy.

Some people get mad when they're driving in very heavy traffic?
what kind of things are you most mad about? I'm most mad about music, films, sport etc.

 **- ness**
illness, tiredness, darkness

To form a noun from an adjective, we sometimes add the letters “ness“ to the adjective. For example, “slow – slowness“, “late – lateness“, “careless – carelessness“ etc.

 **anyone, someone, no one**
Instead of the words “anybody”, “somebody“ and “nobody“, we can use the words “anyone“, “someone“ and “no one“ (or “no-one”).

 **my own, emphasize**
We often put the word “own“ after a possessive adjective when we want to emphasize that something belongs to someone. For example, this is my own pen; it belongs to me. Notice that we can say that this is our classroom because we study here all the time, but we cannot say that this is our own classroom because it doesn’t belong to us.

 **as well, too, also**
The words “as well“, “too“ and “also“ all mean the same thing. The words “as well” and ”too” go at the end of the sentence, but the word “also” usually goes after the first auxiliary verb.
I will be sleeping at 3 a.m.; my sister will be sleeping as well; my mother will be sleeping too; my brother will also be sleeping.

With the present simple and past simple, there is no auxiliary in the positive, so the word “also“ simply goes between the subject and the verb. For example, we say “He speaks German and he also speaks French“.

 **inch, foot, yard:**
This is an inch; this is a foot; this is a yard.
An inch is about two-and-a-half centimetres.
Twelve inches make a foot, and
three feet make a yard.
A yard is about three inches shorter than a metre.

 **hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly**
The words “hourly“, “daily“, “weekly“, “monthly“ and “yearly“ mean “every hour“, “every day“, “every week“, “every month“ and “every year“.
Most radio station have hourly traffic news.

 **Allow, let:**
The verbs “allow“ and “let“ have the same meaning.
The difference is that “allow“ has the infinitive with “to“ after it, whereas “let“ has the infinitive without “to“ after it. For example, we can say “The policeman allowed the man to go home“ or “The policeman let the man go home“. In everyday English, “let“ is more common than “allow“.
The doctor allowed me to change my appointment. The doctor let me change my appointment.
Another difference between “allow“ and “let“ is that we cannot use “let“ in the passive voice. We cannot say “I was let“; we must say “I was allowed“.

 **Anywhere? somewhere/not anywhere,**
 **Where? nowhere, on the wall**

- Is there a book anywhere in this room?
Yes there’s a book somewhere in this room

- If there's nowhere to sit on a bus, what do you have to do?
If there's nowhere to sit on a bus, I have to stand

 **may, can, could**

When we ask for permission to do something, we use the words “may“, “can“ or “could“. For example, “May I leave the room, please?“

 **catch**
We use the word “catch“ in expressions such as “catch a ball”, “catch a train”, “catch a cold” etc.

 **habit/ be in the habit of doing**
The most common way to speak about our habits is to use the present simple or past simple. For example, we say “I drink coffee every day“ or “I usually went to bed early when I was a child“. We sometimes add expressions like “usually“, “always“ or “every week“ so that it is understood that we are speaking about a habit.

 **stranger / foreigner**
A stranger is somebody we don’t know, whereas a foreigner is somebody from another country.

 **travel, journey**
The difference between “travel“ and “journey“ is that we generally use “travel“ as a verb and “journey“ as a noun. For example, “I travelled a long way“ or “The journey was long“.

 **remind, remember**
The difference between the words “remember“ and “remind“ is that we remember something ourselves, without help, whereas, if we forget something, somebody reminds us. In other words, they remember for us.

 **to, at**
The difference between the words “to“ and “at“ is that we generally use “to“ when we are moving in the direction of a place, and “at“ when we are there. For example, “I’m going to the table. Now, I’m (standing) at the table“.

 **towards, destination**
The word “towards” means “in the direction of”. For example, if I say “I’m walking towards the station” it means that I’m walking in the direction of the station; it doesn’t necessarily mean that the station is my destination.

 **much better, much more**
If we put the word “much“ before a comparative, it communicates that the difference between the two things is very big. For example, Germany is bigger than England, but China is much bigger than England.



 **in, within:**  
The time now is (6 o’clock).
If I went out of the room and said to you “I’ll be backin an hour’s time“,
it would mean that I’d be back at (7 o’clock).
If, on the other hand, I went out of the room and said
“I’ll be backwithinan hour“,
it’d mean that I’d be back at any time between now and (7 o’clock)


 **e.g. = exempli gratia = for example**

The letters “e.g.“ are the abbreviation of “exempli gratia“, from the Latin,
which means “for example“. We use these letters in writing, but not in
speaking.

 **mind**
We use “mind” in the abstract sense, whereas we generally use “brain“ in the physical sense.

 **sick, unwell, vomit**
“To be sick“ can mean “to be unwell“, but it can also mean “to vomit“. We usually understand the meaning from the sentence or situation.

 **whatever, whenever, wherever**
- The difference between the words “what“ and “whatever“ is that we use
the word “what“ in a limited sense, whereas we use the word “whatever“
in a more unlimited sense.
Other examples of this kind of thing are:

 **“when – whenever“;**
 **“where – wherever“;**
 **“who – whoever“.**

if you could bu whatever you wanted, what would you buy?

 **ache**
toothache, stomach ache, earache, headache
An ache is a continuous physical pain, such as toothache, headache, stomach ache, earache etc.

 **Ought**
“Ought“ has the same meaning as “should“, but it must be followed by
the infinitive with “to“. For example, instead of saying “I should go now“,
we say “I ought to go now“. In normal everyday conversation, “should“ is
more common than “ought“.

 **ground**
 **underground**
 **ground floor**
 **grounds**

By the word “ground“, we usually mean the surface of the land.

 **draw, drawing, curtain**
The verb “to draw“ means to make a picture with a pencil or pen. It can also mean “to pull“. For example, if you draw the curtains, you pull them open or closed. If you draw money from the bank, you put your bank card in a cash machine and take money out.

 **draw**
The verb “to draw” is sometimes used with a basic meaning of “to move”. For example, we can say that a train draws out of a station, or that winter is drawing near.

 **Over:**
overeat, oversleep, overwork, overcook, undercook, overpay, underpay

When we put the word “over“ before a verb, it sometimes means to do something excessively.
Some verbs, like “overcook“ or “overpay“, form their opposite with the word “under“ – e.g. “undercook”, “underpay”.
Another use of the word “charge“ is in charging a battery, for example in a mobile phone.

 **save, rescue, protect, spend**
The verb “save“ can mean “to keep for the future”, “to rescue”, “to protect”, and “to spend less”.

 **trade, tradesman**
By a trade, we usually mean a job that a person does mainly with their hands, and for which they need a special skill. Some examples of tradesmen are bakers, butchers, builders etc.

 **trip**
A trip is a journey to a place and back again. For example, a business trip, a trip to the shops, a trip around the world etc.

 **gain, earn**
The verb “to earn“ generally means “to receive money for work done“, whereas the verb “to gain“ generally means “to get more of something“. For example, we can gain strength, time, friends etc., or we can gain money through a business transaction.

 **festival, feast**
A festival is a large public party, often to celebrate something. For example, a music festival, summer festival etc. A feast is a special meal, usually to celebrate something. For example, there is usually a feast at a wedding.

 **dare, challenge**
The verb “dare” means “to be brave enough to do something”. For example, “Nobody dared to argue with him”. It is often used in the negative. For example, “They didn’t dare to walk through the woods at night”.

The verb “dare”, like the verb “need”, can be used as both an ordinary verb and a modal verb. For example, instead of asking “Do you dare to try it?”, we can ask “Dare you try it?”, and instead of saying “She doesn’t dare to tell her father what happened”, we can say “She daren’t tell her father what happened”. As a modal verb, “dare” is generally only used in questions and negative sentences, not in positive sentences.

If we dare somebody to do something, it means that we challenge them to do it, to see if they are brave enough. For example, “I dare you to climb that tree”. Note that when the verb “dare” is used with this meaning, it cannot be used as a modal verb.

 **by, by the time**
When we are speaking about time, the word “by“ can mean “at some point before“ or “not later than“. For example, “I will be home by midnight“ means that I will arrive home at some point before midnight, or possibly at midnight, but certainly not later than midnight.


 **elder, eldest**
We generally use the words “elder“ and “eldest“ instead of “older“ and “oldest“ when speaking about people in the same family. However, we cannot say “elder than“. For example, we cannot say “My sister is elder than me“; we must say “My sister is older than me“.

 **Be used to something, Get used to something**

Instead of saying “I played football regularly at school“, we can use the auxiliary “used to“ and say “I used to play football at school“. This sentence expresses a habit or repeated action in the past.

However, we have another, completely different, “used to“ in English. In the sentence “I am used to hot weather“, the word “used“ is an adjective, followed by the preposition “to“. If we say that we are “used to“ something, it means that it is not strange or uncomfortable for us anymore because we have experience of it. If a person from a cold country goes to live in a hot country, at first they feel uncomfortable; they “are not used to“ the weather. Then, they slowly become accustomed to the weather, or “get used to“ the weather. Finally, one day they say “I am used to hot weather“ because now they are comfortable with it.

Notice that, because the word “to“ is a preposition, we put the gerund (“-ing“ form) after the expression “to be used to“, not the infinitive. For example, we say “I am getting used to waking up early“.


 **let, rent, advertise, in exchange for**
The difference between “to let“ and “to rent“ is that “to let“ means to lend something in exchange for money, whereas “to rent“ means to borrow something in exchange for money.


 **eventually**
- When we are taking about the future, we use the word "eventually"
when we know that something is going to happen but we don't know when.
Example:
We will all eventually die, but we don't know when.

- When we are talking about the past, the word "eventually" means
"after all that" or "in the end"
Example:
I spent a long time in the bookshop but eventually decided not to buy anything.

 **be on  the safe side**
if we say we do something "to be on the safe side", it means
that we do it so that there is no risk of something bad happening.
Example:
We don't know how much money we'll need, so let's take a credit card too,
just to be on the safe side.

 **use to**
We use the words “used to” for a habit or repeated action in the past, especially when the action is now finished.
For example, the sentence “I used to go to the cinema every Saturday afternoon” means that I was in the habit of going to the cinema every Saturday afternoon, but not now.

 **B.C.   A.D.  Christ, Lord**
The letters “B.C.” mean “before Christ”, and the letters “A.D.” mean “anno domini” (in Latin) meaning “in the year of our Lord”, although we usually think of this as meaning “after Christ”.
For example, “500 B.C.” means 500 years before Christ, whilst 500 A.D. means 500 years after Christ.

 **not...either**
We generally use the words “also”, “as well” and “too” in positive sentences, but in negative sentences we use “not ... either”.
For example, we say “I like fish and I like meat too”, but in the negative we say “I don’t like fish and I don't like meat either”. Or we say “I have a sister and David has one as well”, but in the negative we say “I don’t have a sister and David doesn’t have one either”.

 **on, upon**
There's no difference between the words “on” and “upon” except that the word “on” is much more common.

 **at last, lastly**
We use the expression “at last” when we feel that we have been waiting for a long time for something to happen and then it happens.
For example, if you agree to meet a friend one evening but they arrive very late, you might say “Here you are, at last!”
We use the word “lastly” to say the last thing in a list. For example, we can say “First, put the tea into the cup. Then, add some hot water. Wait a few minutes and, lastly, drink it”.

Instead of “at last” or “lastly”, we can use the word “finally”.

 **far, a long way**
The word “far” can be used in questions and negative sentences, but it is not generally used in positive sentences. We can use “a long way” instead.
is it far from here to the next town? No it isn't far from here to the next town, Yes it is a logn way from here to the next town.
One exception to this rule is the expression “too far”, which communicates a negative idea.
For example, we can say “It's too far to walk to the station. Let's get a taxi”.

We generally use the word “distant” instead of “far” as an adjective before a noun. For example, we say “The sailor came from a distant country”, and “He is a distant relation of mine”. If we want to be more emphatic, we can sometimes say “a far distant country” or “the far distant future” etc.

 **seat, stool**
A seat is anything that we sit on, for example in a car, in a cinema, or on a bus. The difference between a chair and a stool is that a stool does not have a back.


 **i think so, i hope not**
We can use the words “so” and “not” to avoid repeating a whole sentence that someone has just said. For example, someone says to us “Did you remember to shut the door?” and we reply “Yes, I think so” or “No, I don't think so”. The word “so” saves us repeating the whole sentence “Yes, I think I have shut the door” or “No, I don't think I have shut the door”. The same is true of the word “not”. For example, if someone asks us “Will it rain tomorrow?”, we could reply “I hope not”.

We can also use the word “so” at the beginning of a sentence when we already know something that someone has just told us. For example, if someone says “Peter has passed his exams”, and we already know this fact, we can reply “So I have heard”. We only use this structure with verbs that are connected with the idea of receiving information, such as “tell”, “say”, “hear”, “read” etc.

 **house/home**
Generally speaking, the difference between the words “house” and “home” is that we use “house” when we are thinking about a physical building, whereas we use “home” in a more abstract sense to mean the place where we live or come from. We can use “home” to mean our house, town or country.

Housework is the work we have to do in the house, such as the washing, cleaning, washing up etc., whereas homework is the work a pupil has to do at home.

 **hardly**
The word “hardly” means “almost not”. We must not confuse it with the adverb “hard”. For example, “He hardly works” means that he does almost no work, whereas “He works hard” means that he works a lo

 **racehorse, horse race**
A racehorse is a horse we use for racing, a horse race is a race between horses, and a racecourse is a place where people meet in order to race horses.

 **still, yet**
As we already know, we use the word “still“ for something that is in progress at the moment, whereas we use “yet“ for something that has not begun or happened. This means that “still“ is generally used in positive sentences, whereas “yet“ is generally used in negative and interrogative sentences.

However, it is possible to use “still“ in negative sentences. For example, instead of saying “He hasn’t done the work yet“, we can say “He still hasn’t done the work“. This communicates a feeling of surprise or annoyance, and the word “still“ is stressed in the sentence.

“Still“ can also be used in questions. For example, “Are you still living in London?“. This can also communicate a feeling of surprise or annoyance, but only if there is a heavy stress on the word “still“ in the question. For example, “Are you still in the bathroom, Jane? Please hurry up!“.

Sometimes, we use the words “still“, or more commonly “even“, in a comparative structure in order to communicate that something is surprising. For example, “My brother is tall, but my uncle is still taller“, or “We’re driving fast but we need to drive even faster to avoid being late“.



 **unless = except if**
The word “unless” means “except if”. For example, the sentence “I can meet you later unless I have to work” means “I can meet you later except if I have to work”.

 **to rock, to roll**
The verb “to rock” generally means to move backwards and forwards or from side to side, whereas “to roll” means to go round and round, like a ball.
Another meaning of the verb “to roll” is “to form by rolling”.

 **teacup, cup of tea**
A teacup is a cup for tea, whereas a cup of tea is a cup with tea in it.

 **or so**
The words “or so” mean “about”. For example, “I learnt English for two years or so” means “I learnt English for about two years”.

 **settle,**  
The word “settle” has several different meanings, but the basic meaning is “to come, or bring something, to a comfortable and rested state”. For example, snow settles on a mountain top and a bird settles on the branch of a tree. To settle in a particular country means to make that country your home. To settle a bill means to pay a bill. To settle an argument means to end the argument.

 **injury, wound**
Generally speaking, we use the word “injury” for something we receive by accident and “wound” for something we receive from fighting.

 **seperate, seperate**
There are many words in English that have the same spelling but are pronounced differently. For example:

 **to look forward to**
If you are looking forward to something, it means that you are waiting for it with pleasure. For example, “I always look forward to going on holiday“.

 **let me see**
The expression “Let me see“ means “Give me time to think for a minute“.

 **dust, powder**
The difference between “dust“ and “powder“ is that dust is natural and collects on objects. For example, if a table is not cleaned for a long time, you will find dust on it. Powder, on the other hand, is something that is made. For example, washing powder is powder we put into a washing machine to clean our clothes, and face powder is powder made for the face.

 **dish, serve**
The difference between a plate and a dish is that a plate is flat, whereas a dish is deeper. We usually eat food from a plate, whereas we serve food from a dish. The word “dish” can also mean food made in a particular way, such as fish and chips or chilli con carne.

 **wage, salary**
We use the words “wage“ and “salary“ for the payment received for work done. The difference between “wage“ and “salary“ is that we generally use the word “wage“ for a non-professional job, or a job in which a person earns a fixed amount of money for each hour they work, whereas we generally use “salary“ for a professional job, or a job in which a person earns a fixed amount of money each year.

 **borad**
The basic meaning of the word “board“ is a flat piece of wood. From it, we get “floorboard“, “noticeboard“, “blackboard“ etc.
From the idea that the deck of a boat is made from wooden boards, we get the verb “to board“ and the expression “on board“. We use these when we are talking about getting on or being on boats, ships and planes.

We can also use the word “board“ with the idea of a table, and from this we get, for example, “a board of directors“, which is a group of directors who control a company or other organization. As these people usually meet round a table, we call their meeting a “board meeting“

Also from the idea of a table, we use “board“ with the idea of the food we are given when we stay at a hotel. If we pay for “full board“, we get breakfast, lunch and dinner. If we pay for “half board“, we get breakfast and dinner only. Alternatively, we can simply pay for “bed and breakfast“.

 **rail, railing**
A rail is a piece of metal or wood which is long and thin. For example, a train runs on rails, which is why we call it a railway train.
Railingsareseveralpiecesofmetalorwoodwhichweputaroundthings for protection. We find railings on a balcony to stop people falling, or sometimes around a piece of private land to stop people entering.

 **upper, middle, working, class, society, aristocracy, industrial case, lower**
We sometimes refer to people in society as being “upper class“, “middle class“ or “working class“.
If we say that someone is upper class, we mean that they are very rich or have a lot of power in society.
The upper class are often members of the aristocracy, or are powerful industrialists. By “middle class“, we mean people who are not particularly rich or poor. They are usually professional people such as lawyers, doctors, teachers etc. By “working class“, we mean people who have the least power and money in society. They often do physical work. The idea of “class“ in society differs from country to country, but “upper“, “middle“ and “working“ are the basic divisions.

When describing written English, by “upper case“ letters and “lower case“ letters we mean “capital“ letters and “small“ letters.

 **harbour, port**
Although the words “harbour“ and “port“ are similar in meaning, a harbour is anywhere a boat or ship is protected from the weather, whereas a port is a place where goods are put onto or taken off a ship, or where passengers board a ship. We also use “port“ to mean a town or city with a port. For example, Liverpool is a port.

 **yard, courtyard**
Apart from being a measure of distance, the word “yard” can mean an open space outside a building, enclosed by walls, but with no roof. It is generally used for a special purpose. For example, a farmyard, a schoolyard, a railway yard, a backyard of a house etc.

A courtyard, on the other hand, is a large space, often enclosed by buildings, and is usually found in colleges, castles or very large houses.

The expression “to amuse yourself” means to pass the time, especially when you have nothing else to do. For example, “While we were waiting for the train, we amused ourselves by playing cards”.

 **sensitive,**
The two basic meanings of the word “sensitive“ are “able to notice small changes“ and “easily hurt or offended“.

A sensitive thermometer can measure very small changes in temperature. A sensitive person can be either a kind person who is good at noticing changes in how other people are feeling, or a person who is easily hurt or offended by criticism. If you have sensitive teeth, your teeth can hurt when you have very hot or very cold drinks.

 **sensible, reasonable**
When we are thinking about a person’s behaviour, the opposite of the word “stupid“ is “sensible“. A sensible person behaves in a practical and reasonable manner. For example, it is sensible to look both ways before crossing a road, whereas it is stupid to cross a road without looking both ways. It is sensible to save money for the future rather than spend all your money immediately.


 **thus**
The word “thus” can mean “therefore”. For example, “He was busy with work, and thus could not go to the theatre”. “Thus” can also mean “in this way”, in which case it is followed by the “-ing” form of a verb. For example, “The weather was cold and wet, thus spoiling our trip to the seaside”.

 **whiskers, gap, fence, hedge**
A cat’s whiskers are more or less the same width as its body. This means that, when it goes hunting for mice and birds, it can use its whiskers to measure the width of a gap in a fence or a hedge to see if it is possible to get through the gap without using force and making a lot of noise.

 **hall, entrance, town hall**
A hall is a large room. For example, a large house may have an entrance hall, and schools have dining halls. A town hall is a large building that is used for local government and public meetings.

 **pool, liquid, indoor, outdoor**
 **indoors, outdoors, out of doors**
A pool is a small amount of liquid that has collected in one place. For example, a pool of water, a pool of blood etc. From the word “pool“, we also get the name “swimming pool“.

 **either of them, neither of them**
Notice the way in which we can answer the following:
“Which of these books do you want?“ – “Either of them. It doesn’t matter;
they are both equally interesting“, or “Neither of them; they are both very boring“.

 **underneath**
The difference between “under“ and “underneath“ is the same as that between “after“ and “afterwards“. “Underneath“ means “under that“ or “under it“, and, unlike the word “under“, it does not usually need to be followed by any other words. For example, instead of saying “I knelt down by the car and looked under it“, we can say “I knelt down by the car and looked underneath“.

 **currency, unit, penny, pence**
The currency of a country is the particular money that is used in that country. In the UK, the main unit of currency is the pound. The smaller unit of currency is the penny. A hundred pennies (or more commonly “pence“) make a pound.

We use the word “penny“ to talk about the penny coin itself. The plural is “pennies“. If you are holding six pennies in your hand, you are holding six coins. However, we use the word “pence“ to talk about value. For example, we say “This cake cost ninety pence“.

Instead of saying “pence“, people usually just say “p“. For example, “This pencil cost 70p“.

 **steal, rob, robbery, thief, mask**
Although the verbs “steal“ and “rob“ are quite similar in meaning, there is a difference in grammar, as follows:

“steal“ something “from“ somebody (or somewhere)
“rob“ somebody (or somewhere) “of“ something

For example, we can say “The thief stole my watch from me“ or “The thief robbed me of my watch“.

 **may as well, might as well**
We use the expressions “may as well“ or “might as well“ when we are suggesting something, not because we think it is a great idea but because we cannot think of anything better to do.
For example, if we say “We may as well go home now“, it means that we are suggesting going home only because we cannot think of a better alternative.

 **wooden, hut,**
 **woollen, silken, golden**
A wooden hut is a hut made of wood; a woollen hat is a hat made of wool; a silk dress is a dress made of silk, whereas silken hair is hair which is soft and smooth like silk; a gold watch is a watch made of gold, whereas golden is hair that looks like gold in colour.

 **(just) in case, risk, run a risk**
The expression “in case“, or “just in case“, means “in preparation for the possibility that ...“.
For example, if we say “Here is my phone number in case you need to call me“, we mean “in preparation for the possibility that you need to call me“. If you need to call, you will already be prepared because you will have my number.

The expression “just in case“ can be used at the end of a sentence if it is obvious what we mean. For example, “Here’s my mobile number, just in case“ obviously means “Here’s my mobile number in case you need to call me“.

 **do someone a favour**
 **That's all right**
 **not at all**
 **it's nothing**
 **you're welcome**
 **don't mention it**
 **no problem**

When we give something to someone or do someone a favour, and they say “Thank you“, there are many ways in which we can reply.
Some common expressions we can use are “That’s all right“, “That’s OK“, “Not at all“,“It’s nothing“, “You’re welcome“, “Don’t mention it“, or “No problem“.

 **Two meaning of "quite"**
In front of some extreme adjectives, such as “wonderful“ or “terrible“, the word “quite“ means “completely“. In this situation, we say the word “quite“ with a heavy stress, because we are being emphatic. For example, we can say “The weather is quite wonderful!“. In this sentence, the words “quite wonderful“ mean “completely wonderful“.

 **excuse me, I'm sorry**
We generally use “Excuse me“ for something that is not very important and “I’m sorry“ for a more important apology.

 **then**
The word “then“ has three meanings:
1) At that time – e.g. I’m going to see him on Thursday, so I can give him the news then. 2) Next – e.g. We’ll have dinner first, and then watch TV.
3) In that case – e.g. If you don’t understand, then ask.


 **by:**
There are many expressions in English that contain the word “by“. Here are some examples:

1) “The traffic passed by my house“ means that the traffic went past my house.

2) “Mr Williams lives by himself“ means that nobody lives with him, whereas “Mr Williams did the job by himself“ means that he did it without any help.

3) “He worked by night and slept by day“ means that he worked during the night and slept during the day.

4) “This play was written by Shakespeare“ means that Shakespeare was the writer of this play.

2) “We cooked the meat by roasting it“ means that we used the method of roasting in order to cook the meat.

3) “We’ll have finished the job by this time tomorrow“ means that we’ll finish the job at some time before this time tomorrow.

4) “The workers get paid by the hour“ means that the workers get paid a certain amount for each hour they work.

5) “His office is 6 metres by 4 metres“ means that his office is 6 metres long and 4 metres wide.

6) “He is Chinese by birth“ means that he was born in China.

7) “I know the English alphabet by heart“ means that I can say the English alphabet from memory.

 **nearby:**
“He worked in the town and lived in a nearby village“ means that he lived in a village that was near the town. Notice that we cannot say “a near town“; we must say “a nearby town“.

 **bath, bathe, sunbathe**
The difference between “bath“ and “bathe“ is that “bath“ is generally used as a noun, whereas “bathe“ is generally used as a verb.
We have (or take) a bath in a bathroom, whereas we bathe in the sea, in a river, in a swimming pool etc.

Other uses of the word “bathe“ are, for example, “to sunbathe“, “to bathe a wound with water“ etc.

 **hay, straw**
The difference between hay and straw is that hay is dried grass, whereas
straw is the stems of wheat or other types of corn after it has been cut.

 **lie-lay-lain, lie-lied-lied, lay-laid-laid**
Three verbs which sometimes get confused with one another are:

1) the irregular verb “to lie“, meaning “to be in a horizontal position“, its three forms being “lie, lay, lain“;

2) the regular verb “to lie“, meaning “not to tell the truth“, its three forms being “lie, lied, lied“; and

3) the verb “to lay“, meaning “to put carefully on a surface“, its three forms being “lay, laid, laid“.


 **fellow, society**

As a noun, the word “fellow“ means the same as “man“, but this is quite old-fashioned these days.
As an adjective, the word “fellow“ means “in a similar situation to you“. For example, a fellow traveller, a fellow student, a fellow member of a society etc.

 **hire, plumber**

The words “hire“ and “rent“ are similar, and either word is often possible, but the word “hire“ suggests a shorter period of time than “rent“. For example, we hire a video camera to film a wedding, but we rent a house to live in. If we are speaking about people, we hire somebody to do a
specific job. For example, if we have a problem with our central heating at home, we hire a plumber to fix it. However, if somebody works for us for a long time, we use the verb “employ“. For example, a school employs teachers.

 **make the best of, make the most of**

“Make the best of“ and “make the most of“ have very similar meanings.
“Make the best of“ means to try to be positive even though a situation is not very good.
For example, if it rains every day on holiday, we have to make the best of it.

“Make the most of“ means to get the maximum benefit from a situation while it is available.
For example, if you go to London to learn English, you should make the most of your time there by speaking the language as often as possible.

 **package, parcel, packet**

A package and a parcel are more or less the same thing, but a parcel is normally a package that is sent through the post or delivered to somebody. A packet, on the other hand, is usually a small package that we find in shops, containing several similar items, like sweets, crisps, or cigarettes.

 **disease, contagious**
A disease is an illness, usually one that has a specific cause. Some diseases are contagious, meaning that they can be passed from person to person, like influenza (flu) and typhoid.

 **in time, on time, show**
The phrase “in time” means “before it’s too late”. For example, “We got to the theatre in time to have a quick drink before the show”. The phrase “on time” means “at the correct, or arranged, time”. For example, “My flight from London to Paris left on time”.

 **drag**
We can also use the word “drag“ in a figurative sense; for example, “Whatever you do, don’t drag me into the argument“.


 **flash, thunderstorm, image**
When there’s a thunderstorm, we first see the flash of lightning. Then, after a few seconds, we hear the thunder, even though the thunder and lightning actually happen at the same time. The reason for the delay in hearing the thunder is that sound travels more slowly than light.


 **slide, slip**
The verb “slide“ means “to move smoothly across a surface“, in the way that skis move over snow or ice. The verb “slip“ usually means “to slide by accident“. For example, “He slipped on the banana skin and fell“.

 **onomatopoeia, crash, crush, splash**

There are many words in English that give us an idea of their meaning by their sound. This connection between sound and meaning is known as onomatopoeia. Three examples of this are the verbs “crash“, “crush“ and “splash“.


 **carpet, rug, mat**
The difference between a carpet and a rug is that a carpet is large, usually covering the whole floor of a room, whereas a rug is smaller, and only covers part of the floor. A mat is something we put in front of a door for people to wipe their feet on before entering a house.

 **at last, in the end, outcome**
When we are talking about positive outcomes, we can use either “at last“ or “in the end“. For example, “At last, I managed to open the window“, or “In the end, I managed to open the window“. However, when we are talking about negative outcomes, we can only use “in the end“, and not “at last“. For example, “In the end, I didn’t manage to open the window“.

 **former, latter, the former ... the latter**
When we say “Paris and Rome are capital cities; the former is in France, whereas the latter is in Italy“, we mean that the first mentioned is in France, whereas the second mentioned is in Italy.

 **ANYWAY**

The word “anyway“ can be used in three common ways:

1) With the meaning of “despite that“; for example, “I couldn’t stand her but I had to invite her to the party anyway“.

2) In order to give another reason for something; for example, “That phone is slightly too big for me, and anyway, it’s much too expensive“.

3) In order to change the subject of a conversation, or return to a subject that we were talking about previously; for example, “So anyway, as I was saying, we need to start planning our holiday“.

 **creep - crept - crept**
The word “creep“ means either to move forwards very slowly, or to move slowly and quietly so that nobody hears you.

 **passage, extract**
The word “passage“ can mean a long, narrow space, generally between two buildings, or inside a building, like a corridor. It can also mean a short extract from a speech or a piece of writing.

 **aside**
the word "aside" means "on one side" or "to one side"

 **store, variety, tinned food**
A store is a shop which sells a variety of different goods. It can either be a very large shop in the city, which sells food, clothes, furniture and almost anything you can think of, or it can be a shop in a village that sells many different products that the people in the village might need.

The verb “to store“ means to collect and keep for future use, and the noun “store“ means a collection of something for future use.

 **stove, run on**
A stove can either be used for heating or for cooking, and can run on gas, electricity, wood etc.

 **propose**
If we put a gerund after the verb “propose“, it means “suggest“; if we put an infinitive after it, it means “intend“. For example, “I propose going“ means the same as “I suggest that we go“, whereas “I propose to go“ means “I intend to go“.

 **funny**
Apart from meaning “amusing“, the word “funny“ can also mean “strange“. For example, “It’s funny that Richard hasn’t contacted us recently; I wonder if he’s OK“.

 **strict**
If a parent or teacher is strict, it means that they make sure that their children or pupils behave well and do not break rules.

Another meaning of the word “strict“ is “exact“.

 **committee, parliamentary**
A committee is a group of people appointed to deal with a particular matter. Usually this group is part of a larger organization. For example, we have university committees, trade union committees, parliamentary committees, and so on.

 **it's two weeks since...**
The sentence “It’s two weeks since I watched TV“ means that I have not watched TV in the last two weeks; the last time I watched TV was two weeks ago. The structure is “It’s“ + time period + “since“ + past tense.


 **stuff, manufacture**
The word “stuff“ is similar in meaning to the word “thing“. The difference is that “thing“ is a countable noun, whereas “stuff“ is an uncountable noun. For example, instead of saying “What are all these things on the table?“, we could say “What is all this stuff on the table?“.

 **avenue**
An avenue is a road with trees on either side, or it can be a wide street (with or without trees) with buildings on either side.

 **bundle**
A bundle is a number of articles or objects fastened together. For example, a bundle of sticks, or a bundle of clothes.

 **saw**
A saw is a tool used for cutting (or sawing) wood, metal etc.

 **vessel, blood vessel**

# 23 Suffix, Prefix

 **- ing**



 **Changing the letter "y" to "i"**

One useful spelling rule to remember is that when a word ends in the letter “y“ with a consonant before it, we change the “y“ to “i“ when adding a suffix. For example, “study – studied“. The exception to this rule is when we add the suffix “-ing“. In this case, the “y“ does not change. For example, “study – studying“.

If a word ends in the letter “y“ with a vowel before it, the “y“ does not change to “i“ when we add a suffix. For example, “delay – delays“.

 **-ish**
When we add the suffix “-ish“ to an adjective, it means “rather“ or “more or less“. For example, “France is not exactly a big country, like Russia or the USA, but it’s biggish compared with countries like England and Scotland“.

We can also use the suffix “-ish“ to mean “about“ when we say a time of day. For example, if someone says that they will come to your house at “eightish“, they mean “about eight“.

## 23.1 Change of spelling with comparison of adjectives

When an adjective ends in a single consonant preceded by a single vowel, the consonant is doubled when we form the comparative and superlative. For example,“big – bigger than – the biggest“.

When an adjective ends in a consonant plus “y“, the “y“ is changed to “i“. For example, “happy – happier than – the happiest“.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-94_

## 23.2 S suffix

 **1. -s -es (plural)**
 **- Çoğul yapmak için kullanılır. -s ve -es olarak isim sonuna eklenir. tırnak kullanılmadan eklenir.**
plural, plural of, etc.
what's the plural of book? the plural of book is books

 **2. -s -es (3rd person)**
Normally in the present tense we add S to the end of the verb in the 3rd person (He, She, It).
He swims every morning

 **3. - 's**    **(contraction)**
what **colour's**  this pencil? (what colour is this pencil?)
This pencil's black

 **4. 's  (Possessive)**
 **What's**  your **mother's**  name? (first 's , contraction of "is". second 's is possessive )

- Eğer isim çoğul ise ve -s ile bitiyorsa, iyelik eki olarak üst tırnak gelir ' :
Myparents' flat is quite small. (possessive)
Anne babamın dairesi epey küçük.
Thegirls' bedroom is upstairs.
Kızların yatak odası üst katta.

Where's (where is) the pen? - The pen's(pen is) on the book
what colour's (colour is) this pencil?, this pencil's black

we only use s  apostrophe plural, 3rd person

- burade üçüncü tekil  şahıslarda 's takısı is ile  karıştırılmamalı.
he is  - he's
he has - he's

what's your mother's name

what's=what is
mother's= annenin

 **The possessive apostrophe**
For people and animals, we almost always use the apostrophe to communicate possession.
For example, we say “Mr Johnson’s tie“, “my uncle’s house“, “the horse’s tail“ etc. We sometimes use it for things as well.
For example, we can say
“The book’s main purpose is to teach“, which is the same as saying “The main purpose of the book is to teach“.
However, for things, we generally communicate possession by using the word “of“, and we say, for example, “the door of the house“, or “the smell of the food“.

## 23.3 "-ed" Pronunciation

 **"-ed" Pronunciation**

- When the past tense of a regular verb ends in the leters "ded" or "ted"
the final sound is pronounced "id"
  * Example:
needed, decided, wanted, tasted

* When the past tense of a regular verb does not end in the letter "ded" or "ted"
the final sound is pronounced "t" or "d"
  * Example:
asked, touched, realized, phoned

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-95_

## 23.4 Doubling consonants

 **Doubling consonants, Suffix**
Sometimes, we need to double the final consonant of a word before we can add a suffix beginning with a vowel.
We do this when a word of one syllable ends in a single consonant preceded by a single vowel. For example, “big – bigger“, “hit – hitting“, “fit – fitted“ etc.

 **Unfinished sentences ending with “to”**
Sometimes we leave a sentence unfinished, ending it with the word “to“.
For example, instead of saying “She didn’t kiss him, but she wanted to kiss him“, we can say
“She didn’t kiss him, but she wanted to“.
We do this with verbs that are followed by the infinitive with “to“, including the auxiliaries “ought to“, “used to“ and “have to“.

Some other uses of “take“ are “take a holiday“, “take a break“, “take an exam“ etc.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-130_

## 23.5 Common verb suffixes

 **LESSON-172**

 **Common verb suffixes**

Some common suf xes we use to form verbs are: “-en”, “-ify”, “-ize” (sometimes spelt “-ise”) and “-ate”.

For example, from the word “hard”, we can make the verb “harden”; from the word “simple”, we can make the verb “simplify”; from the word “standard”, we can make the verb “standardize”, and from the word “active”, we can make the verb “activate”.

Some other examples are: “soften”, “ripen”, “identify”, “notify”, “minimize” (or “minimise”), “computerize” (or “computerise”), “alternate” and “regulate”.

Word pool 3 (nouns)

kettle alarm wrinkle glue blister hood canteen jug label heel frost monster ant circus lamb

 **put on, turn out, put on weight**

“Put on” can be used instead of “switch on” or “turn on” when referring to a light, a TV, a cooker etc. For example, “She put on the radio to hear the news”. We can also use “turn out” instead of “turn off”, but only for a light – not for other things.



## 23.6 Common prefixes

 **LESSON-177**

 **Common prefixes**

Some more common pre xes that we use in English are: “pre-” (meaning “before”), “en-” (meaning “make” or “give”), “mis-” (meaning “wrong” or “bad”), and “ex-” (meaning “previous” or “out”).

 **weep – wept – wept**
The verb “to weep” means to cry as a result of emotion (rather than physical pain). We usually weep because of sadness, but can also weep as a result of joy, relief, frustration etc.


 **as for**
The expression “as for ...” means “as regards ...” and we use it when we want to move on to a different aspect of a particular topic. For example, “The government has made major improvements in education. As for the health system, however, it still has a great deal of work to do”.

 **Word pool**
 **knit**
 **dial**

# 24 Quantity

## 24.1 Any/Some - Many/Specific

- The meaning of “any“ and “some“ is “birkac“, but we use “any“ in questions and negative sentences, and “some“ in positive sentences.
For example, we say
“Are thereanybooks on the table?” – “Yes, there aresome books on the table”, and we say (positive answer: some)
“Are thereany books on the floor?” – “No, there arenot any books on the floor“. (negative answer: not any)

- We use “any“ in a non-specific question, when the number is not important.
For example,
“Are there any books on the table?“ – “Yes, there are some books on the table“, or “No, there aren’t any books on the table“.

- If the number is important, we use “How many“ and there is a specific answer – “one“, “two“, “three“ etc., or “none“.

 **Any, Non Specific **
Question : Are there **any**   books on the table?
Negative :  No there aren't **any**   books on the table
Positive :    Yes there are **some**   books on the table

 **Many, Specific**
Question :  How many books are there on the table?
Positive: There are 3 books on the table.
Negative: There aren't books on the table

 **“Anything** “ and **“something“**  both mean the same thing.  We use “anything“ in questions and negative sentences, and we use “something“ in positive sentences.
For example, we say
“Have I gotanything in my right hand? Yes, you’ve gotsomething in your right hand.  (positive answer: something)
Have I gotanything in my left hand? No, you haven’t gotanything in your left hand.“ (negative answer: not anything)

“Anything“ we use in a non‐specific question, whereas “What?“ is specific and has a specific answer – “a light, a book“ etc., or “nothing“.

 **how many - how much**
- how many (countable)
how many pages do you read? (200, none)
how many students are there in the classroom? (12, none)

- how much (uncountable)
how much do you like your mother?
there isn't much milk in the bottle.
how much money do you have?
how much is 3 plus 4? -  2 plus 4 equals seven.
how many pictures are there on these walls?  there are two pictures on these walls

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-9_

## 24.2 anybody, somebody, nobody

- Both “anybody“ and “somebody“ mean “...“. We use “anybody“ in questions and negative sentences, and “somebody“ in positive sentences.
For example, we say
“Is thereanybody sitting here? Yes, there’ssomebody sitting here. (positive answer: somebody)
Is thereanybody sitting there? No, there isn’t anybody sitting there“. (negative answer: not anybody)

 **- anybody, who**
“Anybody” is non‐specific and has a non-specific answer, whereas “who“ is specific and has a specific answer
“Mrs Brown”, “Mr Smith” etc., or “nobody”.
who is he?
who are there?

 **- Only one negative**
in English, in a negative sentence, we use only one negative word, not two
For example, we say "There isn't anything on this chair". A sentence with two negative words has a positive meaning

In English, in a negative sentence, we use only one negative word, not two.
For example, we say “There isn’t anything on this chair“. A sentence with two negative words has a positive meaning.
For example, “There isn’t nobody on this chair“ means that there is somebody on the chair. “I have not got nothing in my pocket“ means that I have got something in my pocket.

 **- nothing, none**
what are you wearing on your head?   i'm wearing nothing on my head
how many books are there on the floor?  - there are none

 **- no= not any**
i have not got any books = i have got no books
We prefer to say "Mr Brown suit" and not "the suit of Mr Brown"

The negative of "can" is "cannot", and contraction of "cannot" is "can't"

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-13-16-19_

## 24.3 Many, much, few little, a lot of

 **many      more .... than        the most**
 **few         fewer .... than       the fewest**
 **much       more ... than         the most**
 **little        less .... than          the least**

 **Countable's**
many ,    more than, the most
few, fewer than, the fewest
books, pens, people

 **Uncountables**
much, more than, the most
little, less than, the least
water, sugar, money, bread

 **- We use “many“ with things we can count.**
For example, we can count pens – one pen, two pens, three pens etc. We can count books, chairs etc.
- Generally, the things we can count have an “s“ in the plural.
“People“ is an exception. It has no “s“, but it is plural and we use “many” with it. For example, “There are many people in this town”.

 **- We use “much“ with things we cannot count.**
For example, we cannot count water or sugar. We cannot say “one water, two waters”; “one sugar, two sugars” etc. These things are a singular quantity and have no “s”.
Money is not an exception; we can count money, but we do not say “one money, two monies”. We say “one pound, two pounds”; “one dollar, two dollars” etc.

 **- We use "few" with things we can count, an "little" with things we cannot count.**

- The difference between “the fewest“ and “the least“ is the same as the difference between “fewer ... than“ and “less ... than“. We use “the fewest“ with things we can count, whereas we use “the least“ we use with things we cannot count.
For example, “Of these three places, London, Cambridge and Greenwich, Greenwich has the fewest buildings“, and “Of these three people, Mr Brown, Mr Smith and Mr Jones, Mr Jones drinks the least coffee“.

- We can use "much" in questions and negative sentences, but in positive sentences we generally use "a lot of".
i eat much bread
i eat a lot of bread. ** **

- We can use "a lot of" instead of many and much

- The difference between “fewer ... than“ and “less ... than“ is that we use “fewer ... than“ with things we can count, and “less ... than“ with things we cannot count. For example, “I have fewer thumbs than fingers. I drink less milk than water“.

- What can we use instead of "many" and "much"? - we can use "a lot of" instead of many and much
do the English drink a lot of coffee? - No, The English don't drink a lot of coffee; they drink a lot of tea


- çokluk derecesini sorarken ve cevaplarken cümlenin sonuna geliyor.
Do you go to the cinema a lot? - yes i go to the cinema a lot
do you read a lot? - no i don't read a lot.
does he eat a lot? - yes he eats a lot, no he doesn't eat a lot\

# 25 Clause and Phrase

 **Clause:**  clause is short sentences it have always S+V and it have meaning
  - independent clause: it can standalone
  - dependent clause : we don't use alone

 **Phrase:**  combined words, it hasn't meaning alone, it has not S and V

## 25.1 Clauses, Conjunction, Phrases

 **Clauses:**
A clause is any group of words with asubjectand averb.
For example, “The door opened” is a clause; “I cooked the chicken” is a clause.

 **Clause:**  clause is short sentences it have always S+V and it have meaning
  - independent clause: it can standalone
  - dependent clause :  it cant't standalone

 **Conjunction:**  is a word that joins clauses together to make long sentences.
Some common conjunctions are words like “and”, “because”, “but”, “so” and “if”.
The sentence “You can borrow my car” has only one clause.
The sentence “You can borrow my car if you promise to be careful” contains two clauses, and they are joined together by the conjunction “if”.

 **Main Clause, Dependent (or subordinate) clause**
A main clause contains the main message of the sentence. A dependent clause contains other information,
For example about time. In the sentence “He'll cook dinner when he gets home”, the main clause is “He'll cook dinner” and the dependent clause is “when he gets home”. A main clause can make sense on its own; a dependent clause cannot. Dependent clauses are also known as subordinate clauses.

With sentences like this, we can put the conjunction and dependent clause first, followed by a comma and then the main clause.
For example, we can say “If you want, you can go home now” instead of “You can go home now if you want”. However, the conjunctions “and “, “or” and “but” cannot start sentences like this.

 **Verb + object + adjective**
A few verbs, like “make” and “keep”, can be used in the construction “verb + object + adjective”. For example, “Milk will **make you strong** ” and “The wind **keeps us cool** ”.

 **Phrases:**  combined words, it hasn't meaning alone, it has not S and V
A phrase is a collection of words that belong together in a sentence because, together, they form a particular part of the sentence.
For example, the following sentence has four phrases in it: “My elder brother / has eaten / two sandwiches / since breakfast”.

Before opening the window of a train or a bus, we can say to the other passengers “Excuse me, would you mind if I opened the window?” (or “Do you mind if I open the window?”).


_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-99_

## 25.2 Time clause, Conditional clause

 **Time Clause, Conditional clause**
Two common types of dependent clause are time clauses and conditional clauses.

A time clause communicates time information for the action in the main clause.
For example, in the sentence “I'll cook dinner when I get home”, the time clause is “when I get home”. It communicates when I will cook dinner. Time clauses can start with the words “when”, “after”, “before”, “until” etc.

A conditional clause usually starts with the word “if” and communicates conditional information for the action in the main clause. For example, in the sentence “You can borrow my car if you promise to be careful”, the conditional clause is “if you promise to be careful”. It communicates that you can borrow the car only on condition that you promise to be careful.

We must remember that we cannot use future tenses in time clauses and conditional clauses; we use present tenses instead. For example, we cannot say “When the lesson will finish, I will go home”. Instead, we must say “When the lesson finishes, I will go home”. We cannot say “If the weather will be good, we will go to the park”. Instead, we must say “If the weather is good, we will go to the park”.

# 29 Sorulara cevap vermek

Soru sorulduğunda dikkat edilmesi gereken konular.

- Hangi zamanda sorulduğuna dikkat et (cümle hangi yardımcı fiil ile başlıyor, çünkü tüm sorular yardımcı fiilerle başlar)
   soru kelimelerinden (what, where, why) sonra asıl cümleye başlarken tüm zamanlarda yardımcı fiilerle ile başlıyor zaten.

- Soru sorulduğunda ikinci olarak dikkat etmek gereken konu ise Subject
   ingilizcede tüm zamanlarda ister positive olsun ister negativ cümle yapısı tektir ve Subject ile başlar,
   bu yüzden cevap vermeye başlarken Subject ile başlanır.

- S+ yardımcı fiil +V + O, bu kurala göre
   Subject ile başladığımız cümlede sorunun sorulduğu zaman yardımcı fiilini kullanırız sonra fiil kullanırız

# 35 Make a suggestion

 **Making a suggestion**

Here are four common ways in which we can make a suggestion:

1- Shall we go to cinema?
2- Let's go to the cinema
3- How (or What) going to the cinema?
4- Why don't we go to the cinema?

# 36 titles- sir,madam,gentleman,lady,mr,mrs

to be polite: ** sir, madam, gentleman @**  army, school, shops
 **Mr, bay**
 **Mrs: Evli bayan**
 **Miss-Ms: bayan**

To be polite, people who work in shops, hotels etc. use the words “sir“, “madam“ or “miss“ when they speak to customers.
Also, in the army, a soldier calls his officer “sir“, and at school, a pupil sometimes calls his teacher “sir“ or “miss“.

When we want to sound polite, we can use the words “gentleman” and “lady” instead of “man” and “woman”.
For example, we can say “Who is that gentleman over there?“ or “The lady I spoke to on the phone yesterday told me to call again today”.

Everybody has a title. For most people, it is “Mr“, “Mrs“, “Miss“ or “Ms“. For example, John Brown’s title is “Mr“, so we call him “Mr Brown“. The title “Mrs“ is for married women; the title “Miss“ is for unmarried women; the title “Ms“ can be used for either married or unmarried women.

Some people have other titles, such as “Sir“ and “Lady“. For example “Sir Paul McCartney“ and “Lady Diana“.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-67_

# 37 Emphatic Do

- As you already know,
we use the auxiliary verb “do“ for the present simple, but only in questions and negative sentences;
it is not used in the positive.
For example, we say “Do you speak English?“ and “I do not speak English“,
but we say “I speak English“, with no auxiliary “do“.

1. However, when we want to be emphatic about something, we can also use “do“ in a positive sentence.
For example, if someone says to you “You don’t speak English“,
you can reply “Yes I **do**   speak English!“
In situations like this, we put a heavy stress on the word “do“.

2. We usually use the emphatic “do“ when we want to deny something that
someone has said because we know it is not true.
For example, if someone says to you “You don’t eat healthy food“, you can deny this strongly by
saying “Yes I do eat healthy food!“

3. Another use of the emphatic “do“ is in an exclamation.
For example, “I do like this book!“ and “He does speak good English!“
I do hate noisy children!
She does write beautifully!

4. Of course, we can use the emphatic “do“ with the past simple too.
For example, “I did study hard last year!“ and “I did like that book you gave
me!“

Remember that we only use the emphatic “do“ with the **present and past simple.**   
With other tenses, we just stress the first auxiliary verb, or the negative word in the verb.
For example, “Yes Ican speak English well!“
and “No Iwon’t make a mistake!“

In a formal letter or email, we begin with the words “Dear Sir” or “Dear Madam” if we do not know the name of the person we are writing to. We generally end such a letter or email with “Yours faithfully”, or something less formal like “Kind regards” or “Best regards”.

If we do know the name of the person we are writing to, we begin with “Dear (Name)” and we can end with the words “Yours sincerely” or, again, “Kind regards” or “Best regards”.

In an informal letter or email, we usually begin with the words “Dear (Name)” or “Hi (Name)” and end with “Best wishes”, “Love” etc.

# 39 discuss, argue, quarrel

 **discuss, discussion,**
 **argue, argument**
 **quarrel, anger, reason**

- If people discuss something with each other, it means that they talk about something in a serious or formal manner.
People often express different opinions in a discussion but it is rarely unpleasant.

- If people argue about something with each other, it means that they disagree strongly on a subject and become angry.

- If people quarrel about something with each other, it means that they lose control of their anger,
and start shouting and saying unpleasant things to each other.

- Therefore, we could say that two people could begin by quietly discussing a subject,
thediscussion could then develop into anargument, and the argument could finish in aquarrel.

- Another meaning of the verb “to argue“ is “to reason“.
For example,“He argues that he could not finish the job because he didn’t have sufficient time“, or
“His argument for not finishing the job was that he didn’t have sufficient time“.


 **plural of nouns and third person singular of verbs**
Generally speaking, when a word ends in the letters “o”, “s”, “x”, “z”, “ch” or “sh”, we form its plural, if it is a noun, and its third person singular of the present simple tense, if it is a verb, by adding the letters “es” to it.
For example, “one potato – two potatoes” and “I go – you go – he goes”. The word “piano” is an exception; we say “one piano – two pianos”.
If the noun or verb ends in a consonant plus “y”, the “y” is changed to “i” and then the letters “es” are added. For example, “one lady – two ladies” and “I cry – you cry – he cries”.

 **plural of nouns ending in "f" or "fe"**
When a noun ends in “f“ or “fe“, we generally make its plural by changing the “f“ or “fe“ to “ves“. For example, “leaf – leaves“, “loaf – loaves“, “shelf – shelves“, “knife – knives“, “life – lives“, “wife – wives“ etc. However, three common exceptions to this rule are “chefs“, “cliffs“, and “roofs“.

# 40 Giving, asking for opinions

 **in my view**
 **from my point of view**
 **if you ask me**
 **as far as I'm concerned**

There are various expressions we can use to give an opinion in English. We already know “I’d say”, but some other expressions are “in my opinion”, “in my view”, “from my point of view”, “if you ask me”, “as far as I’m concerned” etc. Of course, we can also use these expressions to ask for opinions.

_Resources: Callan Book LESSON-134_

# 41 Communicating general beliefs and opinions

 **Communicating general beliefs and opinions**

 **It is known that dogs are clever**

 **Dogs are known to be clever**

Instead of saying “People in general know that dogs are clever“, we can say “It is known that dogs are clever“ or “Dogs are known to be clever“. We can use both these structures with several verbs, such as “say“, “believe“, “think“, “know“, “feel“, “consider“ etc.

chest, drawer, chest of drawers, wardrobe

A chest is also a large, strong box, usually made of wood, which we use for storing things in, such as clothes, tools, medicine, money etc.

A chest of drawers is a chest with drawers in it. We usually keep clothes in it. A wardrobe is a tall piece of furniture that we hang big pieces of clothing in, like dresses, suits etc.

# 42 Writing

## 42.1 General advice for writing

 **LESSON-166**

 **General advice for writing**

 **punctuation**
 **linking words**

When we create a piece of writing, we should:

• make a simple plan on paper before we start to ensure that we include all the information we need to, and that our information is clearly organized;

• check our punctuation, spelling and grammar when we’ve  nished.

 **garment entitle**

From: Douglas Freeman
To: Samuel Bradley
Subject: Refund request

Dear Mr Bradley * (1-Remember to have an introduction paragraph that tells the reader why you’re writing and what they’re going to read about. ) *

I am writing to complain about a T-shirt that I bought from your Kingsley Street store on 22nd November, and to make a request for a refund. The T-shirt in question is red, medium size, and from your “Forever” range. After wearing the garment once, I washed it at 40 ̊C, the recommended temperature. However, during the wash, the T-shirt lost much of its colour and is now pink. Moreover, it shrank to almost half its original size and is therefore unwearable.

I returned to your store on 25th November but I was informed by a member of staff that I was not entitled to a refund owing to the fact that the T-shirt had already been washed. I explained the situation but, although the lady was very polite, she did not offer me my money back. I was advised instead to contact you directly if I wished to take the matter further.
(**)
(***)I have been a loyal customer of Bradley & Co. for several years and have never had any issue with the products I have bought. **However(****)** , I hope you are able to understand the frustration that I feel in this case, and that you will consider this request for a full refund.

 *(**) Separate your writing into different paragraphs so that the reader knows when you’re changing subject, or starting a new point.*

 *(***)  Avoid using contractions when you want to use a formal style. To decide whether a piece of writing should be written in a formal style or not, think about who will read it.*

 *(****) Use linking words and expressions to connect your ideas together clearly.*

## 42.2 Writing an informal letter or email

 **LESSON-170**

 **Writing an informal letter or email**

 **delicious**

Hi Sophie ( *1) We usually start an informal letter or email with “Dear (Name)” or “Hi (Name)”* .  

This is just a quick email to let you know about my plans for Mike’s 30th birthday on 17th August.

I’ve decided to arrange a surprise party for him! Remember he was away on business last August and ended up spending the evening all alone in his hotel room!

So, my plan is that people meet up at 7pm at the Gatepost. It’s a fantastic place some colleagues took me to the other week right in the centre of town. From outside, it looks nothing special at all, but there’s *(2) We should use contractions in an informal letter or email.* a lovely garden round the back that we can book for the evening. There’s even a covered area in case it rains.

I’ll tell Mike we’ve got theatre tickets or something (to make sure he dresses up a bit) but I’ll suggest a quick drink at the Gatepost  rst. When we’ve got our drinks, I’ll bring him out to the garden. Then, as soon as we appear, you can all start singing ‘Happy Birthday’ – he won’t know what’s going on!

If everything goes according to plan, there should be about twenty of us, and my idea would be to have dinner there too (although it’s not a proper restaurant, the food when I went was delicious). What do you reckon?

I’d better get going now *(3) We can signal to the reader that we’re about to  nish by using expressions like “I’d better get going”, “Looking forward to hearing from you soon”, “Can’t wait to see you”, and “Send my love to your family”.*  because my lunch break’s almost over. I know you and Derek are free on the day because we chatted about that last week, but let me know what you think of my plans.  

Bye for now

## 42.3 Writing a cover letter

 **LESSON-171**

 **Writing a cover letter**

Please note: There are writing homework titles at the end of this book.

 **along with**
 **availability**
 **CV (curriculum vitae)**
 **highlight**
 **summarize**
 **enthusiasm**

A cover letter:
• is a formal letter that we send along with our CV when we apply for a job;

• is written for three main reasons: to say which job we’re applying for, to persuade the reader that our CV is worth reading, and to let them know our availability for interview;

• should start (if we know the name of the person dealing with applications) with “Dear Mr Jones”, not “Dear David” or “Dear David Jones”; and at the end, we should write “Yours sincerely”. If we don’t know the name of the person dealing with applications, we should start with “Dear Sir or Madam”; at the end, we should write “Yours faithfully”.


Dear Mr Jones

I am writing to apply for the position of Sales Assistant that I saw advertised in the Daily Standard on 14th July.( *2) If appropriate, say where and when you saw the advert for the position.*    

 *(3) Highlight and summarize any particularly relevant experience and skills from your CV.* As you can see from my CV, I already have over three years of retail experience, and have spent the last nine months working in a busy high-fashion sales environment.   



Although I am currently employed, I feel that working for your company would offer me a new and exciting challenge. ( *4) Show your enthusiasm for the*  **I have always admired**  the quality of the suits and other formal clothing you produce, and, as such, would be able to bring genuine enthusiasm to any sale. Working in your outlet would also present me with an opportunity to put into practice the tailoring skills that I acquired whilst studying fashion at university.

When dealing with people in the workplace, I pride myself on my **friendly and professional manner** , and customers can rely on my high level of **attention to *detail* **  * (5) Mention any relevant abilities and personal qualities you have.* to ensure they leave with the product best suited to their individual needs. I feel strongly that this is the main reason I have managed to build loyalty among my customers, some of whom return on a regular basis.

 **Thank you(**  *6) Thank the company for considering your application.*  for taking the time to consider my application. I am available to attend an interview at any time *(7) Mention your availabiliy for interview* , and look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

## 42.4 Writing a report

LESSON-176

Writing a report

impersonal recommendation subheading

A report:

• is a highly organized document, written for a speci c person or group of people (often a boss at work, a member of another organization, a committee etc.);

• provides information on a particular situation or event. People then usually use the report and its conclusions to make decisions;

• uses a formal and impersonal style. We use the passive voice where possible, avoid the use of contractions, and avoid using the pronoun “I” in the main paragraphs;

• contains main paragraphs that deal with different aspects of the report topic.

outdated, in light of, measure, implement


 **Attracting young customers**
( *1) Put a title at the start, but using ‘to/ from/subject’ lines, as in an email, is  fine too.*    

 **Introduction**

The aim of this report is to look at ways of making our bookshop more popular with young adult customers. In preparation for this, 250 local residents between the ages of 16 and 30 were interviewed, revealing three main issues.
 *(2) Say why you’re writing the report.    *
 *(4) Give each paragraph a subheading so the reader knows what it’s about.*  (
 *3) Say where your information comes from.*   
 **Shop interior**
At present, the walls of the shop are dark blue, and the shelves are black. Over 75% of those questioned stated that they found these colours dull and not very welcoming.
 **    Stock**  ( *4) Give each paragraph a subheading so the reader knows what it’s about.*  
   Lastly, 64% of people stated that they would visit the shop if there was an area where they could sit down, relax and have a cup of coffee. Many people said it would make them feel they could take their time, without being under any pressure to make a purchase.
 **Conclusion**
 *(6) You should put your own opinions, conclusions and recommendations in the conclusion paragraph.*
( *5) Main paragraphs should report information or state facts rather than give your own personal opinions* . Another important matter is that over half the young people surveyed felt that our stock was somewhat outdated. It seems that a signi cant number of people are choosing to go elsewhere to buy books by more contemporary authors. Seating area   In light of the above, it appears that one priority should be to redecorate the shop using brighter and more attractive colours. It also seems clear that further research is called for into the type of books we should stock. Lastly, an area of the shop should be selected to become a seating area with sofas, chairs, and a hot-drinks machine. I am con dent that, if the above measures are implemented, we will see a rapid improvement in sales as well as in the store’s reputation among young people.

## 42.5 Emphasis: Inversions after negative or limiting adverbials

 **LESSON-167**

 **Emphasis: Inversions after negative or limiting adverbials**

Some examples of negative adverbials are: “not only”, “no sooner”, “never”, “by no means”, and “under no circumstances”.

Some examples of limiting adverbials are: “rarely”, “hardly”, “barely”, and “little”.

Sometimes we put adverbials like these at the start of a sentence in order to emphasize their meaning. When we do this, we need to use an inversion, or, in other words, we use the same form and word order as we would use for questions, even though we are not asking a question.

For example, instead of saying “I have never met such a rude man”, we can emphasize the idea of “never” by saying “Never have I met such a rude man”. Notice that, even though this sentence is not a question, we say “have I met” rather than “I have met”. Another example of an inversion is “Hardly had I walked into my of ce when the phone started ringing”. This means that the phone started ringing immediately after I walked into my of ce.

 **call in, call by**
The phrasal verb “call in” means “visit brie y”, but notice the following difference in structure: we call in on someone, whereas we call in at a place.
We can also call by (at) a place.


 **Common prefixes (1)**
 **respectively**

A pre x is a group of letters we add at the beginning of a word, usually to change the meaning of the word. For example, the pre xes “over-” and “under-” add the meanings of “too much” and “too little” respectively. So, the verb “overeat” means “eat too much” and “undereat” means “eat too little”.

Some other common pre xes are: “re-” (meaning “again”), “co-” (meaning “together”), “un-” (meaning “not” or “opposite of”), and “inter-” (meaning “between”).


 **weep – wept – wept**
The verb “to weep” means to cry as a result of emotion (rather than physical pain). We usually weep because of sadness, but can also weep as a result of joy, relief, frustration etc.

 **as for**
The expression “as for ...” means “as regards ...” and we use it when we want to move on to a different aspect of a particular topic. For example, “The government has made major improvements in education. As for the health system, however, it still has a great deal of work to do”.

## 42.6 the bigger... the more....

 **LESSON-178**

 **the bigger ... the more ...**

When we are comparing only two people or things, it is possible to use the word “the” in front of a comparative adjective rather than a superlative adjective. For example, “I have two bedrooms in my  at. The smaller of the two is used as a store room”.


 **economic, economical, cutback, cut back**
The word “economic” means “related to money or the economy”. For example, we can say “The country is facing severe economic problems”. The word “economical”, on the other hand, means “providing good value” or “requiring less money than usual”. For example, we can say “The car cost quite a lot to buy, but it’s very economical to run”.

 **storey, skyscraper**
We generally use the word “storey” when we are referring to the architecture or structure of a building, whereas we use “ oor” when talking about the different levels within a building. For example, we would say “Mr Brown’s cousin lives on the  fth  oor of a ten-storey block of  ats”.


 **instruct, instructor**
The verb “instruct” means “teach” but is generally used to describe teaching someone how to perform an activity. For example, we can say “The staff were instructed on what to do in the event of a  re”.


## 42.7 Writing a story

 **LESSON-180**

 **Writing a story**
Please note: There are writing homework titles at the end of this book.

 **sequence, set the scene, departure gate, boarding pass, devastated**

Always check!

 *(1) It’s normal to use contractions when we write a story.*   
I was  nally off to my brother’s wedding. I’d never had the opportunity to visit New York before and I could hardly wait. I had a while to wait before boarding so, in the meantime, I sat in one of Heathrow Airport’s many coffee bars to watch the planes taking off.

 *(3) Use the past simple to communicate the main events in the story.*
 *(2) Linking expressions that communicate ‘time’ and ‘sequence’ ideas are especially important.    *  

Before long, my  ight was announced, and I quickly made my way to the departure gate. I was standing in the queue when suddenly my stomach turned over. Where was my boarding pass? And my passport?

I ran like I’d never run before. In my mind, I could still see my passport and boarding pass lying on the coffee bar table. I ’d left them there in my mad hurry to get to the gate in time. How could I be so stupid!

 *(4) Use the past continuous to set the scene and give background information.*
 *(5) Use the past perfect to mention something that happened at an earlier time.*

I burst into the coffee bar and went immediately to the table I’d been sitting at; my documents weren’t there! I stood there in silence, devastated.

  “Is this yours, sir?” said a voice behind me politel.

 *(6) Make descriptions more interesting by using adjectives and adverbs.*

I turned to see a smiling waiter, and in his hand, a British passport with a boarding pass sandwiched between its pages.

“Yes! Oh, thank you,” I replied. “Thank you so much!”
“You’re very welcome,” he said calmly. “Now, you’d better get going, hadn’t you, sir?” I took the documents and set off back, possibly even faster than before. I arrived, completely out of breath, just as the staff were about to close the gate.      

“Wait!” I called out desperately, opening the passport at the photo page as I approached them. I looked down at the face in the picture. It wasn’t mine.

 **umpire, referee, cricket**
The role of an umpire and the role of a referee are similar: to control a sporting activity and make sure the rules are followed correctly. A referee generally moves around a lot, as in football and boxing. An umpire, on the other hand, generally remains in one position, as in tennis and cricket.

 **turnover**
The turnover of a company is the value of the goods and services that the company sells in any particular period.

## 42.8 in prison, to church, at university

 **LESSON-181**

 **in prison, to church, at university**

We do not use the de nite article “the” in front of certain nouns when we are referring to their primary purpose. Some examples are “prison”, “church”, “hospital”, “school”, “college”, “university”, and “bed”.

For example, the primary purpose of a prison is to contain criminals, so if we say “John is in prison”, we are communicating that John is a criminal. On the other hand, if we say “John is in the prison”, we are simply stating his physical location; perhaps he is visiting someone.

Similarly, if we say “Peter is at university”, we are communicating that Peter is a student. If, on the other hand, we say “Peter is at the university”, again we are just saying where he is.


 **Common noun suffixes**
Some common suf xes we use to form nouns are: “-ness”, “-ment”, “-ance”, “-ence”, “-ship”, “-hood”, “-ity”, and “-ion”.

Some examples of such nouns are “greatness”, “enjoyment”, “acceptance”, “correspondence”, “membership”, “motherhood”, “regularity”, and “adoption”.

## 42.9 Writing an essay

 **LESSON-185**

 **Writing an essay**

Please note: There are writing homework titles at the end of this book.

An essay:

• is a short piece of writing that presents ideas on a particular topic and discusses them. The writer reaches some kind of conclusion at the end;

• is usually written by students (at school, college or university) for a teacher, professor etc.

“For young single adults, living alone is a better option than sharing accommodation.” Discuss.


 * (1) Start with general information that introduces the topic of your essay.*
  Most young single adults live either with family members or friends. However, these days, many are choosing to live on their own.

 * (2) Each paragraph should focus on a particular point, or aspect of the topic, that you want to discuss.*

One advantage of not sharing accommodation is that you have control over your time. You can go out with friends whenever you like, but if you want a quiet evening with a book or  lm, for example, you can have it; there is nobody around to interfere with your plans.  

 Another bene t of living alone is that you are not forced to put up with other people’s annoying habits, whether it is dirty plates in the sink or loud music late at night. Living  alone means you automatically avoid the awkward conversations and arguments that housemates often have about things like this.
 * (3) Make your ideas clearer by illustrating them with examples.  *

On the other hand, sharing accommodation with others is normally far cheaper than living alone, and this is a major advantage. Rent is cheaper as it is shared among everyone in the property, and heating and electricity bills are also lower for the same reason.

Furthermore, living with other people means you are likely to have a more sociable lifestyle. Of course, you can invite friends round when living alone but, in a shared house or  at, everybody else’s friends come to visit too and you get to know more people. Perhaps more important than this, though, is that there is nearly always someone around to chat with if you feel lonely. Unlike someone who lives alone, you do not need to make arrangements to meet.  

 *  (4) Put closely related points together in the same paragraph.*

 *   (5) Make sure your own personal opinion is clear in the conclusion. In conclusion*

I feel that living alone is not the best option. Humans are social animals, and I would always prefer to be around friends or family, despite how annoying they can occasionally be.

 **mumble, mutter**
If someone is speaking so quietly and unclearly that we can’t understand them properly, we say they are mumbling, and we might ask them to speak more clearly. If someone is speaking quietly to themselves, we say they are muttering. People often mutter when they’re complaining to themselves about something.

## 42.10 Writing an article

LESSON-187

 **Writing an article**

Please note: There are writing homework titles at the end of this book.

journal blog factual eye-catching


An article:

• is normally published in a magazine, newspaper or journal, or on a website such as a blog. It can be about any topic;

• usually contains factual information about the topic, but also gives the opinions of the writer and even other people

• should be interesting/useful, as the reader has no obligation to keep reading;

• can have a number of different purposes (to inform, entertain, advise etc.);

• can use a formal, neutral or informal style, depending on where it will be published and who will read it.

approach, systematic, do your utmost, socialize, keep at


So many English Words!

 *(1) Make sure you have an eye-catching title that also gives information about the topic.*

When you’re learning English, how can you possibly remember every word you come across? You can’t, but here are some suggestions to help you acquire the vocabulary you need.

 *(1) Make sure you have an eye-catching title that also gives information about the topic. So many English Words!*
 *(2) Get the reader’s attention by having an interesting  rst sentence or introduction paragraph.*

Firstly, outside school, only learn what’s useful. Everyone knows how it feels to be chatting in English and suddenly realize you’re missing a really important word. In my view, one great idea is to use a notebook or an app on your phone to jot down such words in your own language. Then, later,  

look them up in English and record them in a ‘personal vocabulary book’. When reading, you should take a similar approach. Look up words, but again, only record what you think will come in handy later. There’s no point learning high-level or specialized vocabulary you’ll never need again. Another important thing is to be systematic. Decide how you’re going to record words – by topic, by date, or maybe just alphabetically. By all means use more than one method, but be organized.

But to remember words, revision is the answer. Why not create a numbered card  ling system with ten words or so and their translations on each card. You carry one card with you every day, and test yourself to see if you know the items on it, and try to use them in conversations too! The next day, you study a different card, and so on. But you need to return to each card regularly, and revise until you know all the words on it.

 *  ‘Talk’ to the reader directly by using the pronoun “you” where appropriate, and by using the imperative for giving advice etc. This helps to keep the reader interested.   *

 Above all, never forget that practice makes perfect. So, do your utmost to write and speak English regularly. Visit internet chat rooms, socialize with people who can speak English, or, best of all,  nd a job where you’ll speak English sometimes.

Finally, never give up! The more words you know, the easier it is to remember new ones. So get organized, keep at it, and before long you’ll be communicating like a native!

 **not nearly, nowhere near, nothing like**
When we’re comparing things, we can put “not nearly”, “nowhere near” or “nothing like” in front of the structure “as ... as ...” to communicate that the difference between the two things is very big. For example, if I say “My town is not nearly as big as London”, I mean that my town is very small compared to London. If I say “The problem is nowhere near as serious as I’d imagined it would be”, I mean that the problem is far less serious than I had imagined it would be.

## 42.11 Reduced relative clauses

 **LESSON-189**

 **Reduced relative clauses**

 **prepositional phrase . omit**

Sometimes, we can reduce the length of a relative clause that contains the verb “be” by omitting the relative pronoun and the verb “be”. Three common situations in which we can do this are:

1) When the main verb in the relative clause is in the continuous form. For example, instead of saying “The girl who is wearing the yellow hat is my sister”, we can say “The girl wearing the yellow hat is my sister”.

2) When the main verb in the relative clause is in the passive voice. For example, instead of saying “The teenagers who were arrested will probably go to prison”, we can say “The teenagers arrested will probably go to prison”.

3) When the relative pronoun and the verb “be” are followed by a prepositional phrase. For example, instead of saying “The pen which is on the table is mine”, we can say “The pen on the table is mine”.

Note that, although there are exceptions, we normally reduce de ning rather than non-de ning relative clauses. For example, we would not choose to reduce the (non-de ning) relative clause in the following sentence: “My mother, who is taking piano lessons now, clearly has no talent”.


Also note that, when we reduce a relative clause, we can only omit the verb “be” when the relative pronoun is the subject. For example, the sentence “The picture that is hanging on the wall looks great” can be reduced to “The picture hanging on the wall looks great” because the relative pronoun “that” is the subject. However, in the sentence “The picture that John is painting looks great”, the subject of the relative clause is the word “John” (the word “that” is, in fact, the object). Therefore, we cannot reduce the relative clause by omitting the verb “be” (and so we cannot say “The picture John painting looks great”).


 **Common adjective suffixes**
Some common suf xes we use to form adjectives are: “-al”, “-ive”, “-ous”, “-ic”, “-y”, “-able” and “-ible”. Some examples of such adjectives are “experimental”, “progressive”, “poisonous”, “melodic”, “sleepy”, “predictable” and “reversible”.

## 42.12 Writing a review

 **LESSON-191**

 **Writing a review**

 **Please note: There are writing homework titles at the end of this book.**

 **overview, assessment, verdict**

 **A review:**

• is a piece of writing that tells the reader about a place, event, book,  lm, or other product, and also gives the writer’s opinions on it. We  nd reviews in newspapers and magazines, or on websites;

• is intended to help the reader decide if they want to buy the product, watch the  lm etc;

• normally contains three main parts: an overview, an assessment, and a verdict.

 **stand out, blend, portion, enthusiastic**

 **Porthole (London Bridge)**

There are several new places to eat in the London Bridge area, but Porthole certainly stands out from the rest. This large restaurant, spread over two  oors, overlooks the river, and is within easy walking distance of both London Bridge and Waterloo stations.  

 * (1) Start with an overview to give the reader some basic facts about whatever you are reviewing.*

 Porthole serves a reasonably priced and exciting blend of European and Asian cuisines. The menu contains enough variety to satisfy most tastes, and includes an interesting range of vegetarian dishes. On my visit, both my food and that of my companion was cooked to perfection, and portions were generous.

Service is friendly and enthusiastic, although the restaurant was very busy on my visit and we had to wait patiently for our order to be taken. The only other slight negative is perhaps the drinks menu. This may well improve over time but, at the moment, the selection is rather poor. There are only two types of tea available, for example, and the wine list is somewhat limited.   

 *(2) Include an assessment, giving your opinions, both positive and negative.   *

However, what will bring me back to Porthole again and again is the view. London’s historic river stretches out in front of you, with the Tower of London and Tower Bridge right nearby.
